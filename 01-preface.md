## Rationale and Organization

* Intended as an online update to my print book [@chakraborty2017observer].
* All references in this book to `RJafroc` refer to the R package with that name (case sensitive) [@R-RJafroc]. 
* Since its publication in 2017 `RJafroc`, on which the `R` code examples in the print book depend, has evolved considerably causing many of the examples to "break" if one uses the most current version of `RJafroc`. The code will still run if one uses [`RJafroc` 0.0.1](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/RJafroc/) but this is inconvenient and misses out on many of the software improvements made since the print book appeared.
* This gives me the opportunity to update the print book.
* The online book has been divided into 3 books.
    + The [RJafrocQuickStartBook](https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocQuickStart/) book.
    + The [RJafrocRocBook](https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocRocBook/) book.
    + **This book:** [RJafrocFrocBook](https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocFrocBook/).
