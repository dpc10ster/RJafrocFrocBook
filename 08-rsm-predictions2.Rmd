## TBA Introduction {#rsm-pred2-intro}

The preceding chapter described the radiological search model (RSM) for FROC data. This chapter describes the ROC curve predictions of the RSM. The starting point is a general characteristic of all RSM predicted operating characteristics, namely they have the constrained end-point property. Derived next is the predicted *inferred ROC* curve followed by the predicted FROC and AFROC curves. 

Shown next is how *search performance* and *lesion-classification* performance can be measured from the inferred ROC curve. Search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions, and lesion-classification performance is the ability, having found a suspicious region, to correctly classify it. Lesion-classification is different from (case) classification performance, i.e., distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased cases, which is measured by the area AUC under the ROC curve. 

TBA Based on the ROC/FROC/AFROC curve predictions of the RSM, a comparison is presented between area measures that can be calculated from FROC data, leading to an important and perhaps surprising conclusion, *the FROC curve is a poor descriptor of search performance and that the AFROC/wAFROC curves are preferred*. Most applications of FROC methods, particularly in CAD, have relied on the FROC curve to measure performance.

In this chapter formulae for RSM quantities are given in terms of the RSM search parameters $\lambda$ and $\nu$.  



## The RSM-predicted FROC curve {#rsm-pred2-froc-curve}

The derivation of the FROC curve is much simpler. From the property of the Poisson distribution, namely, its mean is the $\lambda'$ parameter of the distribution, it follows that the expected number of latent NLs per case is $\lambda'$. One multiplies this by $P \left ( Z > \zeta \mid Z \sim N(0,1) \right )$, i.e., $\Phi(-\zeta)$, to obtain the expected number of latent NLs per case that is actually marked, i.e., NLF:

\begin{equation}
NLF \left ( \zeta, \lambda' \right ) = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \Phi \left (-\zeta \right )
(\#eq:rsm-pred2-froc-nlf)
\end{equation}


Diseased cases are separated into groups, each with a fixed number of $L$ lesions per case, where $L$ varies from one to $L_{max}$. For each group characterized by $L$, one seeks the fraction of the expected number of latent LLs per case divided by the total number of lesions in each case (L). Since $\nu'$ is the probability that a lesion is found, it must equal the desired fraction. Next, one multiplies by $P \left ( Z > \zeta \mid Z \sim N(\mu,1) \right )$ i.e., $\Phi(\mu - \zeta)$, to obtain the fraction that is actually marked. Finally, one performs a weighted summation over the different groups with $f_L$  as the weighting fraction. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
LLF\left ( \zeta, \mu, \nu', \overrightarrow{f_L} \right ) =& \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L \nu'  \Phi \left ( \mu - \zeta \right )\\
=& \nu'  \Phi \left ( \mu - \zeta \right )\\
= \left ( 1-\text{exp}\left ( -\nu \mu \right ) \right )  \Phi \left ( \mu - \zeta \right )& 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
(\#eq:rsm-pred2-froc-llf)
\end{equation}


Note that $LLF\left ( \zeta, \mu, \nu', \overrightarrow{f_L} \right )$ is independent of $\overrightarrow{f_L}$. Summarizing, the coordinates of the RSM-predicted point on the FROC curve are given by Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred2-froc-nlf) and Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred2-froc-llf). The FROC curve starts at (0,0) and ends at $\left ( \lambda', \nu' \right )$. The x-coordinate does not extend to arbitrarily large values and the y-coordinate does not approach unity (unless $\nu'$).  The constrained end-point property, demonstrated before for the ROC curve, also applies to the FROC curve:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
NLF_{max} =& \lambda / \mu\\
LLF_{max}=& 1 - \text{exp}(-\nu \mu))\\
\end{aligned}
\right \}
(\#eq:rsm-pred2-froc-max)
\end{equation}

## The RSM-predicted AFROC curve {#rsm-pred2-froc-afroc-curve}

The AFROC x-coordinate is the same as the ROC x-coordinate and Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred-fpf) applies. The AFROC y-coordinate is identical to the FROC y-coordinate and the second Eqn. \@ref(rsm-pred2-froc) applies. The second expression on the right hand side uses the intrinsic RSM parameters. Note that the expression is independent of the number of lesions in the dataset or their distribution (unlike the AFROC, the weighted AFROC does depend on the lesion distribution  ) TBA!!. The limiting coordinates of the AFROC are: 

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\text{FPF}_{\text{max}} =& 1 - \text{exp}\left (\lambda / \mu \right ) \\
LLF_{max}=& 1 - \text{exp}(-\nu \mu))\\
\end{aligned}
\right \}
(\#eq:rsm-pred2-froc-fpf-llf-max)
\end{equation}

It too has the constrained end-point property. In terms of the intrinsic RSM parameters, As $\mu$ increases starting from $0+$, $\text{FPF}_{\text{max}}$ decreases starting from $1-$, approaching $0+$ as $\mu$ approaches $\infty$. In the same limit, $\text{TPF}_{\text{max}}$ increases starting from 0, approaching $1-$. [The notation "1-" denotes a number just less than one.] 

Source the file `mainRsmAFROC.R`. Note the change at line 7 with type = "AFROC", which generates AFROC plots shown in Fig. 17.4 (A-F) for the following values of  : 0.001, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

As $\mu$ increases, the area under the AFROC increases monotonically from 0 to 1. The reader should check that this is true regardless of the choices of the other parameters in the model. This is expected of a well-behaved area measure that can be used as a figure of merit. 

Experiment with different values for the parameters to confirm that the following statements are true:

1.	The AFROC plot is independent of the number of lesions per case. Area under AFROC is independent of  . These statements are not true for the wAFROC TBA!!. In contrast, the ROC ordinate increases with increasing numbers of lesions per case.  

2.	From Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred2-froc-tpf-max) and Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred2-froc) it follows that $\text{TPF}_{\text{max}} \geq LLF_{max}$  with the equality holding in the limit $\mu \rightarrow \infty$. 

The physical reason for $\text{TPF}_{\text{max}} \geq LLF_{max}$  is that the ROC gives credit for incorrect localizations on diseased cases, while the AFROC does not. This is the well-known "right for wrong reason" argument [@bunch1977free] originally advanced in 1977.

3.	As   increases the AFROC curve more closely approaches the upper-left corner of the plot, denoting increasing performance and the area under the AFROC curve approaches 1, which is the best possible performance: (a)  decreases and (b)   increases, denoting decreasing numbers of incorrect decisions on non-diseased and diseased cases, respectively. 
4.	For   and non-zero   the operating characteristic approaches the horizontal line extending from the origin to (1,0), which is the continuous section of the curve, followed by the vertical dashed line connecting (1,0) to (1,1) and AFROC-AUC approaches zero. In this limit, none of the lesions is localized and every case has at least one NL mark, which implies worst possible performance.
5.	For   the accessible portion of the operating characteristic approaches the vertical line connecting (0,0) to (0,1), the area under which is zero. The complete AFROC curve is obtained by connecting this point to (1,1) by the dashed line and in this limit the area under the complete ROC curve approaches 1. As with the ROC, omitting the area under the dashed portion of the curve will result in a severe underestimate of true performance. 
6.	As   decreases  decreases to zero while  stays constant, Eqn. (17.35), as the latter is independent of  . 
7.	As   increases  stays constant (it is independent of  ) while  approaches unity. As   increases, the corresponding physical parameter  increases, approaching unity, guaranteeing that every lesion is found. AFROC-AUC approaches one.
8.	Over the range (0,0) to  , the slope of the AFROC decreases monotonically. It is infinite at the origin and zero at the end-point. 


### Chance level performance on AFROC {#rsm-pred2-froc-afroc-chance}

There appears to be a misconception24,25 that chance level performance on an AFROC corresponds to the positive diagonal of the plot, yielding AFROC-AUC of 0.5. Fig. 17.4 (A) shows that chance level performance corresponds to the horizontal line connecting the origin to (1,0) and a vertical dashed line connecting (1,0) to (1,1) corresponding to AFROC-AUC of zero. If the lesion perceptual contrast is zero, then no lesions are found and all marks are NLs. The AFROC-AUC FOM, namely the probability that a lesion rating exceeds the ratings of NLs on non-diseased cases, see §14.2, is zero.


### The reader who does not yield any marks {#rsm-pred2-froc-no-marks}

Suppose the radiologist does not mark any case, as in §13.4.2.2, resulting in an empty data file. One possibility is that the radiologist did not interpret the cases and simply "whizzed" through them. In this situation, the radiologist is not performing the diagnostic task. The AFROC operating point is stuck at the origin and connecting the straight-line extension yields AFROC-AUC = 0.5, would be incorrect as it implies finite performance (any value greater than zero for AFROC-AUC implies some degree of expertise). All models of observer performance assume that the observer is behaving rationally10, so this possibility is not analyzable. On the other hand, there is the real possibility that the radiologist did not detect any lesions and did not mark any non-diseased case. Assuming the radiologist is behaving rationally, one needs an explanation for AFROC-AUC = 0.5. It turns out that this observer is perfect at not generating NLs on non-diseased cases, so no patient is recalled incorrectly. The radiologist needs to get some credit for this ability, and this is the explanation of AFROC-AUC = 0.5 for a rational observer. Since this radiologist's LLF = zero obviously the radiologist is far from perfect. The radiologist needs to be trained to find lesions. A suitable training set would consist of diseased cases only. The FROC data from such a dataset could be analyzed using the AFROC1 figure of merit, which could be used to measure the improvement of the radiologist in finding lesions. There is no point wasting non-diseased cases on this radiologist, as the radiologist has proven perfect performance on them by not generating NL marks on any non-diseased case.

The following code, mainNoMarks.R, illustrates how this observer can be simulated.



The corresponding AFROC plot, obtained by sourcing this code, is shown in Fig. 17.5.

Fig. 5 here

Fig. 17.5: The case of the rational observer who does not mark any image, who operates at (0,0) on the AFROC and for whom the AFROC plot consists only of the dashed straight line extension connecting the origin to (1,1) and AFROC-AUC = 0.5. This observer has better performance (specifically unit case-level specificity) than the worst observer shown in Fig. 17.4 (A) who yielded AFROC-AUC = 0 (zero sensitivity and zero specificity). [This figure was generated by sourcing file mainNoMarks.R]

The explanation lies in the values of the chosen parameters. The   parameter was set to 0.001 as setting it to zero would create a divide by zero error when   is calculated. Instead one sets   to 0.000001, so  . With such small   the probability is almost zero that any case will have a NL mark – according to the Poisson distribution, the probability of no mark is  . Of course, the fact that   is close to zero means the  , so no lesion is found. 

The corresponding code output is shown below.


This tells us that FROC-AUC = 0, ROC-AUC = 0.5 and AFROC-AUC = 0.5. FROC-AUC is meaningless as the operating point is stuck at the origin and one has no idea where it is supposed to end. ROC-AUC = 0.5 means that the observer is showing chance-level performance at the task of separating non-diseased and diseased cases. The ROC paradigm does not credit the observer for avoiding marking non-diseased cases. AFROC-AUC = 0.5 credits the observer for not marking any non-diseased cases but there is no credit for unmarked lesions. The difference between the ROC and FROC paradigms, both predicting AUC = 0.5, but these have different meanings, is because FROC is a location specific paradigm but ROC is not. 





## The RSM-predicted wAFROC curve{#rsm-pred2-wafroc-curve}

The wAFROC abscissa is identical to the ROC abscissa, i.e., Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred2-fpf) applies.


The wAFROC ordinate is calculated using:


\begin{equation} 
\text{wLLF} \left ( \mu, \lambda, \nu, \overrightarrow{f_L}, \mathbf{W} \right ) = \Phi\left ( \mu - \zeta \right )\sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L \sum_{l=1}^{L} \text{W}_{Ll} \, l \, \text{pmf}_{Bin}\left ( l, L, \nu \right )
(\#eq:rsm-pred2-wllf)
\end{equation}


* $\overrightarrow{f_L}$ is the normalized histogram of the lesion distribution for the diseased cases. In the software it is denoted `lesDistr`. For example, the array `lesDistr = c(0.1, 0.4, 0.4, 0.1)`  defines a dataset in which 10 percent of the cases contain one lesion, 40 percent contain 2 lesions, 40 percent contain 3 lesions and 10 percent contain 4 lesions. 

* $L_{max}$ is the maximum number of lesions per case in the dataset. In the preceding example $L_{max} = 4$.

* $\mathbf{W}$ is the (lower triangular) square matrix with $L_{max}$ rows and columns containing the weights, where each row sums to unity. The relative lesion weights are denoted in the code `relWeights`. For example, `relWeights =  c(0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.5)` whose meaning is as follows:

    + On cases with one lesion the lesion weight is unity.
    + On cases with two lesions the relative weights are 0.2 and 0.3. Since these do not add up to unity, the actual weights are 0.4 and 0.6. 
    + On cases with three lesions the relative weights are 0.2, 0.3 and 0.1. The actual weights are 1/3, 1/2 and 1/6.
    + On cases with four lesions the relative weights are 0.2, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.5. The actual weights are 0.2, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.4.
    

* The function `UtilLesionWeightsMatrixLesDistr` calculates the matrix given `lesDistr` and `relWeights`. For example:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
lesDistr <- c(0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1)
relWeights =  c(0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 0.4)
UtilLesionWeightsMatrixLesDistr(lesDistr, relWeights)[,-1]
```


* It is necessary to label the lesions properly so that the correct weights are used. This is done using the `lesionID` field in the Excel input file. For example, `lesionID = 3` for the one with relative weight 0.1. Since $\mathbf{W}$ is independent of cases, the lesion characteristics (which determine clinical outcome) of `lesionID = 1` on cases with one lesion or on cases with 4 lesions are assumed to be identical. In other words this example assumes that the lesions fall into one of 4 groups, with clinical outcomes as in the weights matrix $\mathbf{W}$. 


* $\text{pmf}_{Bin}\left ( l, L, \nu \right )$ is the probability mass function (pmf) of the binomial distribution with success probability $\nu$ and trial size $L$, defined in Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-binomial-pmf). $\text{W}_{Ll}$ is the weight of lesion $l$ in cases with $L$ lesions; for example $\text{W}_{42} = 0.3$. 


* The wAFROC-AUC is obtained by numerically integrating the wAFROC curve defined by Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred2-fpf) and Eqn. \@ref(eq:rsm-pred2-wllf) which is implemented in `UtilAnalyticalAucsRSM`.


* To generate equal weights set `relWeights = 0`, as in following code:


```{r}
lesDistr <- c(0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1)
UtilLesionWeightsMatrixLesDistr(lesDistr, relWeights = 0)[,-1]
```


## TBA Discussion / Summary {#rsm-pred2-discussion-summary}
This chapter has detailed ROC, FROC and AFROC curves predicted by the radiological search model (RSM). All RSM curves share the constrained end-point property that is qualitatively different from previous ROC models. In my experience, it is a property that most researchers in this field have difficulty accepting. There is too much history going back to the early 1940s, of the ROC curve extending from (0,0) to (1,1) that one has to let go of, and this can be difficult. 

I am not aware of any direct evidence that radiologists can move the operating point continuously in the range (0,0) to (1,1) in search tasks, so the existence of such an ROC is tantamount to an assumption. Algorithmic observers that do not involve the element of search can extend continuously to (1,1). An example of an algorithmic observer not involving search is a diagnostic test that rates the results of a laboratory measurement, e.g., the A1C measure of blood glucose  for presence of a disease. If A1C ≥ 6.5% the patient is diagnosed as diabetic. By moving the threshold from infinity to –infinity, and assuming a large population of patients, one can trace out the entire ROC curve from the origin to (1,1). This is because every patient yields an A1C value. Now imagine that some finite fraction of the test results are "lost in the mail"; then the ROC curve, calculated over all patients, would have the constrained end-point property, albeit due to an unreasonable cause.

The situation in medical imaging involving search tasks is qualitatively different. Not every case yields a decision variable. There is a reasonable cause for this – to render a decision variable sample the radiologist must find something suspicious to report, and if none is found, there is no decision variable to report. The ROC curve calculated over all patients would exhibit the constrained end-point property, even in the limit of an infinite number of patients. If calculated over only those patients that yielded at least one mark, the ROC curve would extend from (0,0) to (1,1) but then one would be ignoring the cases with no marks, which represent valuable information: unmarked non-diseased cases represent perfect decisions and unmarked diseased cases represent worst-case decisions.

ROC, FROC and AFROC curves were derived (wAFROC is implemented in the Rjafroc). These were used to demonstrate that the FROC is a poor descriptor of performance. Since almost all work to date, including some by me TBA 47,48, has used FROC curves to measure performance, this is going to be difficulty for some to accept. The examples in Fig. 17.6 (A- F) and Fig. 17.7 (A-B) should convince one that the FROC curve is indeed a poor measure of performance. The only situation where one can safely use the FROC curve is if the two modalities produce curves extending over the same NLF range. This can happen with two variants of a CAD algorithm, but rarely with radiologist observers.

A unique feature is that the RSM provides measures of search and lesion-classification performance. It bears repeating that search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions. Search performance can be determined from the position of the ROC end-point (which in turn is determined by RSM-based fitting of ROC data, Chapter 19). The perpendicular distance between the end-point and the chance diagonal is, apart from a factor of 1.414, a measure of search performance. All ROC models that predict continuous curves extending to (1,1), imply zero search performance. 

Lesion-classification performance is measured by the AUC value corresponding to the   parameter. Lesion-classification performance is the ability to discriminate between LLs and NLs, not between diseased and non-diseased cases: the latter is measured by RSM-AUC. There is a close analogy between the two ways of measuring lesion-classification performance and CAD used to find lesions in screening mammography vs. CAD used in the diagnostic context to determine if a lesion found at screening is actually malignant. The former is termed CADe, for CAD detection, which in my opinion, is slightly misleading as at screening lesions are found not detected ("detection" is "discover or identify the presence or existence of something ", correct localization is not necessarily implied; the more precise term is "localize"). In the diagnostic context one has CADx, for CAD diagnostic, i.e., given a specific region of the image, is the region malignant? 

Search and lesion-classification performance can be used as "diagnostic aids" to optimize performance of a reader. For example, is search performance is low, then training using mainly non-diseased cases is called for, so the resident learns the different variants of non-diseased tissues that can appear to be true lesions. If lesion-classification performance is low then training with diseased cases only is called for, so the resident learns the distinguishing features characterizing true lesions from non-diseased tissues that fake true lesions.

Finally, evidence for the RSM is summarized. Its correspondence to the empirical Kundel-Nodine model of visual search that is grounded in eye-tracking measurements. It reduces in the limit of large  , which guarantees that every case will yield a decision variable sample, to the binormal model; the predicted pdfs in this limit are not strictly normal, but deviations from normality would require very large sample size to demonstrate. Examples were given where even with 1200 cases the binormal model provides statistically good fits, as judged by the chi-square goodness of fit statistic, Table 17.2. Since the binormal model has proven quite successful in describing a large body of data, it satisfying that the RSM can mimic it in the limit of large  . The RSM explains most empirical results regarding binormal model fits: the common finding that b < 1; that b decreases with increasing lesion pSNR (large   and / or  ); and the finding that the difference in means divided by the difference in standard deviations is fairly constant for a fixed experimental situation, Table 17.3. The RSM explains data degeneracy, especially for radiologists with high expertise.

The contaminated binormal model2-4 (CBM), Chapter 20, which models the diseased distribution as having two peaks, one at zero and the other at a constrained value, also explains the empirical observation that b-parameter < 1 and data degeneracy. Because it allows the ROC curve to go continuously to (1,1), CBM does not completely account for search performance – it accounts for search when it comes to finding lesions, but not for avoiding finding non-lesions.

I do not want to leave the impression that RSM is the ultimate model. The current model does not predict satisfaction of search (SOS) effects27-29. Attempts to incorporate SOS effects in the RSM are in the early research stage. As stated earlier, the RSM is a first-order model: a lot of interesting science remains to be uncovered.
