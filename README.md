### RJafrocFrocBook


# What is this repository for? #
* Extended documentation for the CRAN version of the RJafroc package. 
* Eventual goal is to publish this as a book, tentatively titled The RJafroc Book.

# Documentation is available at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocFrocBook/ #
* This book, an extended documentation of the __RJafroc__ package, is undergoing edits. 
* It bypasses the file size limits of __CRAN__, currently 5 MB, which severely limits the extent of  documentation that can be included with the CRAN version of the package.
* Currently the package size (excluding all `vignettes` and `tests`) is at about 4.6 MB on the CRAN Windows platform.
* I have always wondered why `R` packages have a limited number of `vignettes`. Now I know why.
