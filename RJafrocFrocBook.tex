\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the hard-copy version of my book \citep{chakraborty2017observer} the online distribution mechanism was \texttt{BitBucket}.
\item
  \texttt{BitBucket} allows code sharing within a \emph{closed} group of a few users (e.g., myself and a grad student).
\item
  Since the purpose of open-source code is to encourage collaborations, this was, in hindsight, an unfortunate choice. Moreover, as my experience with R-packages grew, it became apparent that the vast majority of R-packages are shared on \texttt{GitHub}, not \texttt{BitBucket}.
\item
  For these reasons I have switched to \texttt{GitHub}. All previous instructions pertaining to \texttt{BitBucket} are obsolete.
\item
  In order to access \texttt{GitHub} material one needs to create a (free) \texttt{GitHub} account.

\section{Introduction}\label{froc-paradigm-intro}}

Until now the focus has been on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) paradigm. For diagnostic tasks such as detecting diffuse interstitial lung disease\footnote{Diffuse interstitial lung disease refers to disease within both lungs that affects the interstitium or connective tissue that forms the support structure of the lungs' air sacs or alveoli. When one inhales, the alveoli fill with air and pass oxygen to the blood stream. When one exhales, carbon dioxide passes from the blood into the alveoli and is expelled from the body. When interstitial disease is present, the interstitium becomes inflamed and stiff, preventing the alveoli from fully expanding. This limits both the delivery of oxygen to the blood stream and the removal of carbon dioxide from the body. As the disease progresses, the interstitium scars with thickening of the walls of the alveoli, which further hampers lung function. By definition, diffuse interstitial lung disease is spread through, and confined to, lung tissues.}, or diseases similar to it, where \emph{disease location is implicit}, this is an appropriate paradigm in that essential information is not being lost by limiting the radiologist's response to a single rating categorizing the likelihood of presence of disease.

In clinical practice it is not only important to identify if the patient is diseased but also to offer further guidance to subsequent care-givers regarding other characteristics (such as location, type, size, extent) of the disease. In most clinical tasks if the radiologist believes the patient is diseased there is a location (or locations) associated with the suspected disease. Physicians term this \emph{focal disease}, i.e., disease located at specific region(s) of the image.

For focal disease the ROC paradigm constrains the collected information to a single rating representing the confidence level that there is disease \emph{somewhere} in the patient's imaged anatomy. The emphasis on ``somewhere'' is because it begs the question: if the radiologist believes the disease is somewhere, why not have them to point to it? In fact they do ``point to it'' in the sense that they record the location(s) of suspect regions in their clinical report, but the ROC paradigm cannot use this information. Clinicians have long recognized problems with ignoring location \citep{BlackDwyer1990, RN1921}. From the observer performance measurement point of view the most important consideration is that neglect of location information leads to loss of statistical power. The basic reason for this is that additional noise is introduced in the measurement due to crediting the reader for correctly detecting the diseased condition but pointing to the wrong location - i.e., \emph{being right for the wrong reason}. One can compensate for reduced statistical power by increasing the numbers of readers and cases, which increases the cost of the study and is also unethical because, by not using the optimal paradigm and analysis, one is subjecting more patients to imaging procedures \citep{RN2662}.

\subsection{Chapter outline}\label{chapter-outline}}

Four observer performance paradigms are compared as to the kinds of information collected and ignored. An essential characteristic of the FROC paradigm, namely \emph{visual search}, is introduced. The FROC paradigm and its historical context is described. Key differences between FROC ratings and ROC ratings are noted. The FROC plot is introduced. A ``solar'' analogy is introduced -- understanding this is key to obtaining a good intuitive feel for the FROC paradigm.

\hypertarget{location-specific-paradigms}{%
\section{Location specific paradigms}\label{location-specific-paradigms}}

Location-specific paradigms take into account, to varying degrees, information regarding the locations of perceived lesions, so they are sometimes referred to as lesion-specific (or lesion-level) paradigms: usage of these terms is discouraged. For example, all observer performance methods involve detecting the presence of true lesions; so ROC methodology is, in this sense, also lesion-specific. On the other hand \emph{location} is a characteristic of true and perceived focal lesions, and methods that account for location are better termed \emph{location-specific} than lesion-specific.

The term \emph{lesion} always refers to a true or real lesion. The prefix ``true'' or ``real'' is implicit. The term \emph{suspicious region} is reserved for any region that, as far as the observer is concerned, has ``lesion-like'' characteristics. \emph{A lesion is a real entity while a suspicious region is a perceived entity.}

There are three location-specific paradigms:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the free-response ROC (FROC) \citep{bunch1977free, chakraborty1989maximum};
\item
  the location ROC (LROC) \citep{starr1977comments, swensson1996unified};
\item
  the region of interest (ROI) \citep{obuchowski2010data}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/4Paradigms} \caption{Upper Left: ROC, Upper Right: FROC, Lower Left: LROC, Lower Right: ROI}\label{fig:froc-paradigm-4}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:froc-paradigm-4} shows a schematic mammogram interpreted according to current observer performance paradigms. The arrows point to two real lesions and the three light crosses indicate suspicious regions. If a suspicious region is marked it is indicated by a dark cross. Evidently the radiologist saw one of the lesions, missed the other lesion and mistook two normal structures for lesions.

In Fig. \ref{fig:froc-paradigm-4}, evidently the radiologist found one of the lesions (the light-shaded cross near the left most arrow), missed the other one (pointed to by the second arrow) and mistook two normal structures for lesions (the two light-shaded crosses that are relatively far from any true lesion).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the ROC paradigm, Fig. \ref{fig:froc-paradigm-4} (top-left), the radiologist assigns a single rating indicating the confidence level that there is at least one lesion somewhere in the image. Assuming a 1 -- 5 positive directed integer rating scale, if the left-most light-shaded cross is a highly suspicious region then the ROC rating might be 5 (highest confidence for presence of disease).
\item
  In the free-response (FROC) paradigm, Fig. \ref{fig:froc-paradigm-4} (top-right), the dark-shaded crosses indicate suspicious regions that were \emph{marked} (or \emph{reported} in the clinical report), and the adjacent numbers are the corresponding ratings, which apply to specific suspicious regions in the image, unlike the ROC paradigm, where the rating applies to the whole image. Assuming the allowed FROC ratings are 1 through 4, two marks are shown, one rated FROC-4, which is close to a true lesion, and the other rated FROC-1, which is not close to any true lesion. The third suspicious region, indicated by the light-shaded cross, was not marked, implying its confidence level did not exceed the lowest reporting threshold. The marked region rated FROC-4 (highest FROC confidence) is likely what caused the radiologist to assign the ROC-5 rating to this image in the top-left ROC paradigm figure.
\item
  In the LROC paradigm, Fig. \ref{fig:froc-paradigm-4} (bottom-left), the radiologist rates the confidence that there is at least one lesion somewhere in the image (as in the ROC paradigm) and marks the most suspicious region in the image. In this example the rating might be LROC-5, the five rating being the same as in the ROC paradigm, and the mark may be the suspicious region rated FROC-4 in the FROC paradigm, and, since it is close to a true lesion, in LROC terminology it would be recorded as a \emph{correct localization}. If the mark were not near a lesion it would be recorded as an \emph{incorrect localization}. Only one mark is allowed in this paradigm, and in fact one mark is \emph{required} on every image, even if the observer does not find any suspicious regions to report.
\item
  In the region of interest (ROI) paradigm, the researcher segments the image into a number of regions-of-interest (ROIs) and the radiologist rates each ROI for presence of at least one suspicious region somewhere in the ROI. The rating is similar to the ROC rating, except it applies to the ROI, not the whole image. Assuming a 1 -- 5 positive directed integer rating scale in Fig. \ref{fig:froc-paradigm-4} (bottom-right) there are four ROIs. The ROI at \textasciitilde9 o'clock might be rated ROI-5 as it contains the most suspicious light-shaded cross, the one at \textasciitilde11 o'clock might be rated ROI-1 as it does not contain any light-shaded crosses, the one at \textasciitilde3 o'clock might be rated LROC-2 or 3 (the unmarked lightshaded cross would tend to increase the confidence level) and the one at \textasciitilde7 o'clock might be rated ROI-1. In the example shown in Fig. \ref{fig:froc-paradigm-4} (bottom-right), each case yields 4 ratings\footnote{When different views of the same patient anatomy (perhaps in different modalities) are available, it is assumed that all images are segmented consistently, and the rating for each ROI takes into account all views of that ROI in the different views (or modalities). The segmentation shown in the figure is a schematic. In fact the ROIs could be clinically driven descriptors of location, such as ``apex of lung'' or ``mediastinum'', and the image does not have to have lines showing the ROIs (which would be distracting to the radiologist). The number of ROIs per image can be at the researcher's discretion and there is no requirement that every case have a fixed number of ROIs.}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{froc-paradigm-vis-search}{%
\section{Visual search}\label{froc-paradigm-vis-search}}

The FROC paradigm in medical imaging is equivalent to a visual search task. Any search task has two components: (i) finding something and (ii) acting on it. Examples of a search tasks are looking for lost car-keys or a milk carton in the refrigerator. Success in a search task is finding the searched for object. Acting on it could be driving to work or drinking milk from the carton. There is expertise associated with any search task. Husbands are notoriously bad at finding the milk carton in the refrigerator (analogy due to Dr.~Elizabeth Krupinski at an SPIE course taught jointly with the author). Like anything else, search expertise is honed by experience, i.e., lots of practice.

Likewise a medical imaging search task has two components (i) finding suspicious regions and (ii) acting on each finding. ``Finding'' is the actual term used by clinicians in their reports. Acting on a finding involves determining if the finding is sufficiently suspicious for cancer to warrant reporting. If a suspicious region is found and provided it is sufficiently suspicious the region is marked and rated for confidence that it is a true (malignant) lesion.

The radiologist does not know a-priori if the patient is diseased and, if diseased, how many lesions may be present. In the breast-screening context, it is known a-priori that about 5 out of 1000 cases have cancers, so 99.5\% of the time odds are that the case has no malignant lesions\footnote{The probability of benign suspicious regions is much higher \citep{Ernster1981Epidemiology}, about 13\% for women aged 40-45.}. Considerably search expertise is needed for the radiologist to mark true lesions with high probability while not generating too many false marks.

At my former institution (University of Pittsburgh) the radiologists digitally outline and annotate (describe) suspicious region(s) that are found. As one would expect from the low prevalence of breast cancer in the screening context, about 5 per 1000 cases in the US, and assuming expert-level radiologist interpretations, about 90\% of breast cases do not generate any marks. About 10\% of cases generate one or more marks and are recalled for further comprehensive imaging (termed diagnostic workup). Of marked cases about 90\% generate one mark, about 10\% generate 2 marks, and a rare case generates 3 or more marks (Dr.~David Gur, private communication, ca. 2015).

Conceptually, a mammography report consists of the locations of regions that exceed the threshold and the corresponding levels of suspicion, reported as a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) rating (the BIRADS rating is actually assigned after the diagnostic workup following a 0-screening rating; the screening rating itself is binary: 0 for recall or 1 for normal).

In the first two clinical applications of the FROC paradigm \citep{Chakraborty1986DigitalVsConv, Niklason1986SimulatedPulmonary} the marks and ratings were indicated by a grease pencil on an acrylic overlay aligned, in a reproducible way, to the CRT displayed chest image. Credit for a correct detection and localization, termed a lesion-localization or LL-event\footnote{The proper terminology for this paradigm has evolved. Older publications and some newer ones refer to this as a true positive (TP) event, thereby confusing a ROC related term that does not involve search with one that does.}, was given only if a mark was sufficiently close (as per proximity criterion, see below) to an actual diseased region; otherwise, the observer's mark-rating pair was scored as a non-lesion localization or NL-event.

The use of ROC terminology, such as true positives or false positives to describe FROC data is not conducive to clarity, and is strongly discouraged.

Definitions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  NL = non-lesion localization, i.e., a mark that is \emph{not} close to any lesion
\item
  LL = lesion localization, i.e., a mark that is close to a lesion
\end{itemize}

What is meant by sufficiently close? One adopts an acceptance radius (for spherical lesions) or \emph{proximity criterion} (the more general case). What constitutes ``close enough'' is a clinical decision the answer to which depends on the application. It is not necessary for two radiologists to point to the same pixel in order for them to agree that they are seeing the same suspicious region. Likewise, two physicians -- e.g., the radiologist finding the lesion on an x-ray and the surgeon responsible for resecting it -- do not have to agree on the exact center of a lesion in order to appropriately assess and treat it. More often than not, ``clinical common sense'' can be used to determine if a mark actually localized the real lesion. When in doubt, the researcher should ask an independent radiologist (i.e., not one used in the observer study) how to score ambiguous marks. A rigid definition of the proximity criterion should not be used.

For roughly spherical nodules a simple rule can be used. If a circular lesion is 10 mm in diameter, one can use the ``touching-coins'' analogy to determine the criterion for a mark to be classified as lesion localization. Each coin is 10 mm in diameter, so if they touch, their centers are separated by 10 mm, and the rule is to classify any mark within 10 mm of an actual lesion center as a LL mark, and if the separation is greater, the mark is classified as a NL mark. A recent paper \citep{Dobbins2016MultiInstitutional} using FROC analysis gives more details on appropriate proximity criteria in the clinical context. \footnote{Generally the proximity criterion is more stringent for smaller lesions than for larger one. However, for very small lesions allowance is made so that the criterion does not penalize the radiologist for normal marking ``jitter''. For 3D images the proximity criteria is different in the x-y plane vs.~the slice thickness axis.}

\hypertarget{multiple-marks-in-the-same-vicinity}{%
\subsection{Multiple marks in the same vicinity}\label{multiple-marks-in-the-same-vicinity}}

Multiple marks near the same vicinity are rarely encountered with radiologists, especially if the perceived lesion is mass-like. \footnote{The exception would be if the perceived lesions were speck-like objects in a mammogram, and even here radiologists tend to broadly outline the region containing perceived specks -- they do not mark individual specks with great precision.} However, algorithmic readers, such as computer aided detection (CAD) algorithms, tend to find multiple regions in the same area. Algorithm designers generally incorporate a clustering step to reduce overlapping regions to a single region and assign the highest rating to it (i.e., the rating of the highest rated mark, not the rating of the closest mark. \footnote{The reason for using the highest rating is that this gives full and deserved credit for the localization. Other marks in the same vicinity with lower ratings need to be discarded from the analysis; specifically, they should not be classified as NLs, because each mark has successfully located the true lesion to within the clinically acceptable criterion, i.e., any one of them is a good decision because it would result in a patient recall and point further diagnostics to the true location.}

\hypertarget{historical-context}{%
\subsection{Historical context}\label{historical-context}}

The term ``free-response'' was coined by \citep{RN897} to describe a task involving the detection of brief audio tone(s) against a background of white-noise (white-noise is what one hears if an FM tuner is set to an unused frequency). The tone(s) could occur at any instant within an active listening interval, defined by an indicator light bulb that is turned on. The listener's task was to respond by pressing a button at the specific instant(s) when a tone(s) was perceived (heard). The listener was uncertain how many true tones could occur in an active listening interval and when they might occur. Therefore, the number of responses (button presses) per active interval was a priori unpredictable: it could be zero, one or more. The Egan et al study did not require the listener to rate each button press, but apart from this difference and with two-dimensional images replacing the listening intervals, the acoustic signal detection study is similar to medical imaging search tasks.

\hypertarget{froc-paradigm-froc-plot}{%
\section{The free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) plot}\label{froc-paradigm-froc-plot}}

The free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) plot was introduced \citep{RN2104} as a way of visualizing performance in the free-response auditory tone detection task.

In the medical imaging context, assuming the mark rating pairs have been classified as NLs (non-lesion localizations) or LLs (lesion localizations):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Non-lesion localization fraction (NLF) is defined as the total number of NLs rated at or above a threshold rating divided by the total number of cases.
\item
  Lesion localization fraction (LLF) is defined as the total number of LLs rated at or above the same threshold rating divided by the total number of lesions.
\item
  The FROC plot is defined as that of LLF (ordinate) vs.~NLF as the threshold is varied. If the points are connected by straight lines the resulting ``curve'' is termed the \emph{empirical FROC curve}.
\item
  The upper-right most operating point is termed the \emph{observed end-point} and its coordinated are denoted \((\text{NLF}_{\text{max}}, \text{LLF}_{\text{max}})\).
\item
  Unlike the ROC plot which is completely contained in the unit square, the FROC plot is not.
\end{itemize}

The rating can be any real number, as long as higher values are associated with higher confidence levels.

If \emph{integer ratings} are used for each recorded mark then in a four-rating FROC study at most 4 FROC operating points will result: one corresponding to marks rated 4s; another corresponding to marks rated 4s or 3s; another to the 4s, 3s, or 2s; and finally the 4s, 3s, 2s, or 1s. An R-rating study yields at most R operating points \footnote{I have seen publications that describe a data collection process where the ``1'' rating is used to mean, in effect, that the observer sees nothing to report in the image, i.e., to mean ``let's move on to the next image''. This amounts to wasting a confidence level. The user interface should present an explicit ``next-image'' option and reserve the ``1'' rating to mean the lowest reportable confidence level.}.

If \emph{continuous ratings} are used, the procedure is to start with a very high threshold so that none of the ratings exceed the threshold and then to gradually lower the threshold. Every time the threshold crosses the rating of a mark, or possibly multiple marks, the total count of LLs and NLs exceeding the threshold is divided by the appropriate denominators yielding the `'raw'' FROC plot. For example, when an LL rating just exceeds the threshold, the operating point jumps up by 1/(total number of lesions), and if two LLs simultaneously just exceed the threshold the operating point jumps up by 2/(total number of lesions). If an NL rating just exceeds the threshold, the operating point jumps to the right by 1/(total number of cases). If an LL rating and a NL rating simultaneously just exceed the threshold, the operating point moves diagonally, up by 1/(total number of lesions) and to the right by 1/(total number of cases). The reader should get the general idea by now and recognize that the cumulating procedure is very similar to the manner in which ROC operating points were calculated, the only differences being in the quantities being cumulated and the relevant denominators.

Chapter \ref{empirical} describes the FROC, and other possible operating characteristics, in more detail.

\hypertarget{froc-paradigm-solar-analogy}{%
\section{The ``solar'' analogy}\label{froc-paradigm-solar-analogy}}

Consider the sun, regarded as a ``lesion'' to be detected, with two daily observations spaced 12 hours apart, so that at least one observation period is bound to have the sun in the sky. Furthermore assume the observer knows his GPS coordinates and has a watch that gives accurate local time, from which an accurate location of the sun can be deduced. Assuming clear skies and no obstructions to the view, the sun will always be correctly located and no rational observer will ever generate a non-lesion localization or NL, i.e., no region of the sky will be erroneously ``marked''.

FROC curve implications of this analogy are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each 24-hour day corresponds to two ``trials'' in the \citep{RN897} sense, or two cases -- one diseased and one non-diseased -- in the medical imaging context.
\item
  The denominator for calculating LLF is the total number of AM days, and the denominator for calculating NLF is twice the total number of 24-hour days.
\item
  Most important, \(\text{LLF}_{\text{max}} = 1\) and \(\text{NLF}_{\text{max}} = 0\).
\end{itemize}

In fact, even when the sun is not directly visible due to heavy cloud cover, since the actual location of the sun can be deduced from the local time and GPS coordinates, the rational observer will still ``mark'' the correct location of the sun and not make any false sun localizations. Consequently, even in this example \(\text{LLF}_{\text{max}} = 1\) and \(\text{NLF}_{\text{max}} = 0\).

The conclusion is that in a task where a target is known to be present in the field of view and its location is known, the observer will always reach \(\text{LLF}_{\text{max}} = 1\) and \(\text{NLF}_{\text{max}} = 0\). Why are LLF and NLF subscripted ``max''? By randomly choosing to not mark the position of the sun even though it is visible, for example, using a coin toss to decide whether or not to mark the sun, the observer can ``walk down'' the y-axis of the FROC plot, eventually reaching \(LLF = 0\) and \(NLF = 0\). The reason for allowing the observer to ``walk down'' the vertical is simply to demonstrate that a continuous FROC curve from the origin to (0,1) can, in fact, be realized.

Now consider a fictitious otherwise earth-like planet where the sun can be at random positions, rendering GPS coordinates and the local time useless. All one knows is that the sun is somewhere in the upper or lower hemispheres subtended by the sky. If there are no clouds and consequently one can see the sun clearly during daytime, a rational observer would still correctly located the sun while not marking the sky with any incorrect sightings, so \(\text{LLF}_{\text{max}} = 1\) and \(\text{NLF}_{\text{max}} = 0\). This is because, in spite of the fact that the expected location is unknown, the high contrast sun is enough the trigger the peripheral vision system, so that even if the observer did not start out looking in the correct direction, peripheral vision will drag the observer's gaze to the correct location for foveal viewing.

The implication of this is that a fundamentally different mechanism from that considered in conventional observer performance methodology, namely \emph{search}, is at work.

\begin{quote}
Search describes the process of \emph{finding} lesions while \emph{not finding} non-lesions and search performance is the ability to find more lesions while minimizing finding non-lesions.
\end{quote}

Think of the eye as two cameras: a low-resolution camera (peripheral vision) with a wide field-of-view plus a high-resolution camera (foveal vision) with a narrow field-of-view If one were limited to viewing with the high-resolution camera one would spend so much time steering the high-resolution narrow field-of-view camera from spot-to-spot that one would have a hard time finding the desired stellar object. Having a single high-resolution narrow field of view vision would also have negative evolutionary consequences as one would spend so much time scanning and processing the surroundings with the narrow field of view vision that one would miss dangers or opportunities. Nature has equipped us with essentially two cameras; the first low-resolution camera is able to ``digest'' large areas of the surround and process it rapidly so that if danger (or opportunity) is sensed, then the eye-brain system rapidly steers the second high-resolution camera to the location of the danger (or opportunity). This is Nature's way of optimally using the eye-brain system. For a similar reason astronomical telescopes come with a wide field of view lower magnification ``spotter scope''.

When cloud cover completely blocks the fictitious random-position sun there is no stimulus to trigger the peripheral vision system to guide the fovea to the correct location. Lacking any stimulus, the observer is reduced to guessing and is led to different conclusions depending upon the benefits and costs involved. If, for example, the guessing observer earns a dollar for each LL and is fined a dollar for each NL, then the observer will likely not make any marks as the chance of winning a dollar is much smaller than losing many dollars. For this observer \(\text{LLF}_{\text{max}} = 0\) and \(\text{NLF}_{\text{max}} = 0\), and the operating point is ``stuck'' at the origin. If, on the other hand, the observer is told every LL is worth a dollar and there is no penalty to NLs, then with no risk of losing the observer will ``fill up'' the sky with false marks.

The analogy is not restricted to the sun, which one might argue is an almost infinite SNR object and therefore atypical. Consider finding stars or planets. In clear skies, if one knows the constellations, one can still locate bright stars and planets like Venus or Jupiter. With less bright stars and / or obscuring clouds, there will be false-sightings and the FROC plot could approach a flat horizontal line at ordinate equal to zero, but the observer will not fill up the sky with false sightings of a desired star.

False sightings of objects in astronomy do occur. Finding a new astronomical object is a search task, where, as always, one can have two outcomes, correct localization (LL) or incorrect localizations (NLs). At the time of writing there is a hunt for a new planet, possibly a gas giant , that is much further than even the newly demoted Pluto.

\hypertarget{froc-paradigm-discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{froc-paradigm-discussion}}

This chapter has served as a general introduction to the location specific paradigms. The FROC paradigm, in particular, is directly related to visual search. The terms lesion-localization (LL) and non-lesion localization (NL) were introduced, to mean locating a true lesion and a false region, respectively. A qualitative definition of search performance was given, namely, the ability to find lesions while not finding non-lesions. This will be quantified in a later chapter. A widely used operating characteristic associated with it, namely the FROC curve, was introduced. A ``solar'' analogy was given that brings out important characteristics of the FROC - in particular its dependence on lesion contrast.

In my experience the FROC paradigm is much misunderstood. Some of this has to do with loose terminology and some to misconceptions regarding the paradigm and the FROC curve. These are summarized below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Loose terminology: using the term ``lesion-specific'' to describe location-specific paradigms.
\item
  Loose terminology: using the term ``lesion'' when one means a ``suspicious region'' that may or may not be a true lesion.
\item
  Loose terminology: using ROC paradigm terms, such as true positive and false positive, that apply to the whole case, to describe location-specific terms such as lesion and non-lesion localization, that apply to localized regions of the image.
\item
  Loose terminology: using the FROC-1 rating to mean in effect ``I see no signs of disease in this image'', when in fact it should be used as the lowest level of a reportable suspicious region. The former usage amounts to wasting a confidence level.
\item
  Misconception: showing FROC curves as reaching the unit ordinate, as this is the exception rather than the rule.
\item
  Misconception: believing that FROC curves extend to very large values along the abscissa and all the observer has to do to access this region is to lower their reporting threshold.
\item
  Misconception: blaming the FROC paradigm for alleged arbitrariness of the proximity criterion and multiple marks in the same region. These are not clinically important.
\end{itemize}

The FROC plot is the first proposed way of visually summarizing FROC data. The next chapter deals with all empirical operating characteristics that can be defined from an FROC dataset and associated scalar measures of performance, termed \emph{figures of merit} (FOMs).

\section{TBA Introduction}\label{empirical-intro}}

FROC data consists of mark-rating pairs. In this chapter a distinction is made between latent and actual marks. This is followed by a table summarizing FROC notation. This is a key table which will be used in later chapters. Section \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(froc-paradigm-froc-plot)} introduced the empirical FROC plot. This chapter presents mathematical expressions for this and other empirical plots possible with FROC data: the inferred-ROC, the alternative FROC, the weighted alternative FROC, and others. Operating characteristics are \emph{visual} depicters of performance. Scalar quantities, typically area measures derived from operating characteristics, are \emph{quantitative} measures of performance, termed \emph{figures of merit} (FOMs). This chapter defines an area measure for each empirical operating characteristic. An FROC dataset is used to illustrate the plots and area measures. With the exception of the FROC plot, all empirical plots include a straight line extension from the observed end-point to (1,1). The correlation between the area measures is qualitatively examined via plots. It is shown that for this dataset the FROC area measure correlates poorly with that under the ROC curve, whereas the other measures correlate better. This is explained by the fact that, unlike the other measures, the FROC plot is not contained within the unit square.

\hypertarget{empirical-mark-rating-pairs}{%
\section{Mark rating pairs}\label{empirical-mark-rating-pairs}}

\emph{FROC data consists of mark-rating pairs}. Each mark indicates the location of a region suspicious enough to warrant reporting and the rating is the associated confidence level. A mark is recorded as \emph{lesion localization} (LL) if it is sufficiently close to a true lesion, according to the adopted proximity criterion, and otherwise it is recorded as \emph{non-lesion localization} (NL).

\emph{In an FROC study the number of marks on an image is an a-priori unknown modality-reader-case dependent non-negative random integer.} It is incorrect and naive to estimate it by dividing the image area by the lesion area because not all regions of the image are equally likely to have lesions, lesions do not have the same size, and perhaps most important, clinicians don't assign equal attention units to all areas of the image. The best insight into the number of marks per case is obtained from eye-tracking studies \citep{RN1490}, but even here the information is incomplete, as eye-tracking studies can only measure foveal gaze and not lesions found by peripheral vision, and such studies are very difficult to conduct in a clinical setting.

\hypertarget{latent-vs.-actual-marks}{%
\subsection{Latent vs.~actual marks}\label{latent-vs.-actual-marks}}

To distinguish between suspicious regions that were considered for marking and regions that were actually marked, it is necessary to introduce the distinction between \emph{latent} marks and \emph{actual} marks.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A \emph{latent} mark is defined as a suspicious region, regardless of whether or not it was marked. A latent mark becomes an \emph{actual} mark if it is marked.
\item
  A latent mark is a latent LL if it is close to a true lesion and otherwise it is a latent NL.
\item
  A non-diseased case can only have latent NLs. A diseased case can have latent NLs and latent LLs.
\item
  If marked, a latent NL is recorded as an actual NL.
\item
  If not marked, a latent NL is an \emph{unobservable event}.
\item
  In contrast, unmarked lesions are observable events -- one knows (trivially) which lesions were not marked.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{binning-rule}{%
\subsection{Binning rule}\label{binning-rule}}

Recall that ROC data modeling requires the existence of a \emph{case-dependent} decision variable, or z-sample \(z\), and case-independent decision thresholds \(\zeta_r\), where \(r = 0, 1, ..., R_{ROC}-1\) and \(R_{ROC}\) is the number of ROC study bins \footnote{The subscript is used to make explicit the paradigm used.} and a binning rule that if \(\zeta_r \leq z < \zeta_{r+1}\) the case is rated \(r + 1\). Dummy cutoffs are defined as \(\zeta_0 = -\infty\) and \(\zeta_{R_{ROC}} = \infty\). The z-sample applies to the whole case. To summarize:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}  
\text{if} \left (\zeta_r \le z < \zeta_{r+1}  \right )\Rightarrow \text {rating} = r+1\\
r = 0, 1, ..., R_{ROC}-1\\
\zeta_0 = -\infty\\
\zeta_{R_{ROC}} = \infty\\
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:binning-rule-roc}
\end{equation}

Analogously, FROC data modeling requires the existence of a \emph{case and location dependent} z-sample for each latent mark and \emph{case and location independent} reporting thresholds \(\zeta_r\), where \(r = 1, ..., R_{FROC}\) and \(R_{FROC}\) is the number of FROC study bins, and the rule that a latent mark is marked and rated \(r\) if \(\zeta_r \leq z < \zeta_{r+1}\). Dummy cutoffs are defined as \(\zeta_0 = -\infty\) and \(\zeta_{R_{FROC}+1} = \infty\). For the same numbers of non-dummy cutoffs, the number of FROC bins is one less than the number of ROC bins. For example, 4 non-dummy cutoffs \(\zeta_1, \zeta_2, \zeta_3, \zeta_4\) can correspond to a 5-rating ROC study or to a 4-rating FROC study. To summarize:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}  
\text{if} \left (\zeta_r \le z < \zeta_{r+1}  \right )\Rightarrow \text {rating} = r\\
r = 1, 2, ..., R_{FROC}\\
\zeta_0 = -\infty\\
\zeta_{R_{FROC}+1} = \infty\\
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:binning-rule-froc}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{empirical-notation}{%
\section{Notation}\label{empirical-notation}}

\emph{Clear notation is vital to understanding this paradigm.} The notation needs to account for case and location dependencies of ratings and the distinction between case-level and location-level ground truth. The notation also has to account for cases with no marks.

FROC notation is summarized in Table \ref{tab:empirical-notation}, in which \emph{marks refer to latent marks}. The table is organized into three columns, the first column is the row number, the second column has the symbol(s), and the third column has the meaning(s) of the symbol(s).

  Row 4: \(s\) location-level truth state: 1 for non-diseased and 2 for diseased.
\item
  Row 5: Similar to row 3, two indices \(l_s s\) are needed to select latent mark \(l_s\) in location-level truth state \(s\). As a useful mnemonic, \(l\) is for \emph{location}.
\item
  Row 6: \(N_{k_t t}\) is the total number of latent NL marks in case \(k_t t\).

  Row 8: The z-sample for case \(k_t t\) and NL mark \(l_1 1\) is denoted \(z_{k_t t l_1 1}\). Latent NL marks are possible on non-diseased and diseased cases (both values of \(t\) are allowed). The range of a z-sample is \(-\infty < z_{k_t t l_1 1} < \infty\), provided \(l_1 \neq \varnothing\); otherwise, it is an unobservable event.
\item
  Row 9: The z-sample of a latent LL is \(z_{k_2 2 l_2 2}\). Unmarked lesions are observable events and are therefore assigned negative infinity ratings (the null-set notation is unnecessary for them).

  Rows 11, 12 and 13: The cutoffs in the FROC study. The lowest threshold is \(\zeta_1\). The other non-dummy thresholds are \(\zeta_r\) where \(r=2,3,...,R_{FROC}\). The dummy thresholds are \(\zeta_0 = -\infty\) and \(\zeta_{R_{FROC}+1} = \infty\).
\item
  Row 14: \(W_{k_2 l_2}\) is the weight (i.e., clinical importance) of lesion \(l_2 2\) in diseased case \(k_2 2\). The weights of lesions in a case sum to unity: \(\sum_{l_2 = 1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} = 1\).

\subsection{A conceptual and notatonal issue}\label{empirical-indexing-marks}}

An aspect of FROC data, \emph{that there could be cases with no NL marks, no matter how low the reporting threshold}, has created problems both from conceptual and notational viewpoints. Taking the conceptual issue first, my thinking (prior to 2004) was that as the reporting threshold \(\zeta_1\) is lowered, the number of NL marks per case increases almost indefinitely. I visualized this process as each case ``filling up'' with NL marks \footnote{I expected the number of NL marks per image to be limited only by the ratio of image size to lesion size, i.e., larger values for smaller lesions.}. In fact the first model of FROC data \citep{chakraborty1989maximum} predicts that, as the reporting threshold is lowered to \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\), the number of NL marks per case approaches \(\infty\) as does \(\text{NLF}_{max}\). However, observed FROC curves end at a finite value of \(\text{NLF}_{max}\). This is one reason I introduced the radiological search model (RSM) \citep{chakraborty2006search}. I will have much more to say about this in Chapter \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(rsm)}, but for now I state one assumption of the RSM: the number of latent NL marks is a Poisson distributed random integer with a finite value for the mean parameter of the distribution. This means that the actual number of latent NL marks per case can be 0, 1, 2, .., whose average (over all cases) is a finite number.

With this background, let us return to the conceptual issue: why does the observer not keep ``filling-up'' the image with NL marks? The answer is that \emph{the observer can only mark regions that have a non-zero chance of being a lesion}. For example, if the actual number of latent NLs on a particular case is 2, then, as the reporting threshold is lowered, the observer will make at most two NL marks. Having exhausted these two regions the observer will not mark any more regions because there are no more regions to be marked - \emph{all other regions in the image have, in the perception of the observer, zero chance of being a lesion}.

The notational issue is how to handle images with no latent NL marks. Basically it involves restricting summations over cases \(k_ t t\) to those cases which have at least one latent NL mark, i.e., \(N_{k_t t} \neq 0\), as in the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \(l_1 = \{1, 2, ..., N_{k_t t}\}\) indexes latent NL marks, provided the case has at least one latent NL mark, and otherwise \(N_{k_t t} = 0\) and \(l_1 = \varnothing\), the null set. The possible values of \(l_1\) are \(l_1 = \left \{ \varnothing \right \}\oplus \left \{ 1,2,...N_{k_t t} \right \}\). The null set applies when the case has no latent NL marks and \(\oplus\) is the ``exclusive-or'' symbol (``exclusive-or'' is used in the English sense: ``one or the other, but not neither nor both''). In other words, \(l_1\) can \emph{either} be the null set or take on values \(1,2,...N_{k_t t}\).
\item
  Likewise, \(l_2 = \left \{ 1,2,...,L_{k_2 2} \right \}\) indexes latent LL marks. Unmarked LLs are assigned negative infinity ratings. The null set notation is not needed for latent LLs.

\section{The empirical FROC plot}\label{empirical-froc-plot}}

The FROC, Chapter \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(froc-paradigm-froc-plot)}, is the plot of LLF (along the ordinate) vs.~NLF (along the abscissa).

Using the notation of Table \ref{tab:empirical-notation} and assuming binned data\footnote{This is not a limiting assumption: if the data is continuous, for finite numbers of cases, no ordering information is lost if the number of ratings is chosen large enough. This is analogous to Bamber's theorem in Chapter 05, where a proof, although given for binned data, is applicable to continuous data.}, then, corresponding to the operating point determined by threshold \(\zeta_r\), the FROC abscissa is \(\text{NLF}_r \equiv \text{NLF}\left ( \zeta_r \right )\), the total number of NLs rated \(\geq\) threshold \(\zeta_r\) divided by the total number of cases, and the corresponding ordinate is \(\text{LLF}_r \equiv \text{LLF}\left ( \zeta_r \right )\), the total number of LLs rated \(\geq\) threshold \(\zeta_r\) divided by the total number of lesions:

\begin{equation}
\text{NLF}_r  = \frac{n\left ( \text{NLs rated} \geq \zeta_r\right )}{n\left ( \text{cases} \right )}
\label{eq:empirical-NLF1}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\text{LLF}_r  = \frac{n\left ( \text{LLs rated} \geq \zeta_r\right )}{n\left ( \text{lesions} \right )}
\label{eq:empirical-LLF1}
\end{equation}

The observed operating points correspond to the following values of \(r\):

\begin{equation}
r = 1, 2, ...,R_{FROC} 
\label{eq:empirical-range-r}
\end{equation}

Due to the ordering of the thresholds, i.e., \(\zeta_1 < \zeta_2 ... < \zeta_{R_{FROC}}\), higher values of \(r\) correspond to lower operating points. The uppermost operating point, i.e., that defined by \(r = 1\), is referred to the as the \emph{observed end-point}.

Equations \eqref{eq:empirical-NLF1} and \eqref{eq:empirical-LLF1} is are equivalent to:

\begin{equation}
\text{NLF}_r  = \frac{1}{K_1+K_2} \sum_{t=1}^{2} \sum_{k_t=1}^{K_t} \mathbb{I} \left ( N_{k_t t} \neq 0 \right )\sum_{l_1=1}^{N_{k_t t}} \mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_t t l_1 1} \geq \zeta_r \right ) 
\label{eq:empirical-NLFr}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\text{LLF}_r  = \frac{1}{L_T} \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}} \mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_r  \right ) 
\label{eq:empirical-LLFr}
\end{equation}

Each indicator function, \(\mathbb{I}()\), yields unity if the argument is true and zero otherwise.

In Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-NLFr} \(\mathbb{I} \left ( N_{k_t t} \neq 0 \right )\) ensures that \emph{only cases with at least one latent NL} are counted. Recall that \(N_{k_t t}\) is the total number of latent NLs in case \(k_t t\). The term \(\mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_t t l_1 1} \geq \zeta_r \right )\) counts over all NL marks with ratings \(\geq \zeta_r\). The three summations yield the total number of NLs in the dataset with z-samples \(\geq \zeta_r\) and dividing by the total number of cases yields \(\text{NLF}_r\). This equation also shows explicitly that NLs on both non-diseased (\(t=1\)) and diseased (\(t=2\)) cases contribute to NLF.

In Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-LLFr} a summation over \(t\) is not needed as only diseased cases contribute to LLF. Analogous to the first indicator function term in Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-NLFr}, a term like \(\mathbb{I} \left ( L_{k_2 2} \neq 0 \right )\) would be superfluous since \(L_{k_2 2} > 0\) as each diseased case must have at least one lesion. The term \(\mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_r \right )\) counts over all LL marks with ratings \(\geq \zeta_r\). Dividing by \(L_T\), the total number of lesions in the dataset, yields \(\text{LLF}_r\).

\hypertarget{empirical-definition-empirical-auc-froc}{%
\subsection{Definition: empirical FROC plot and AUC}\label{empirical-definition-empirical-auc-froc}}

The empirical FROC plot connects adjacent operating points \(\left (\text{NLF}_r, \text{LLF}_r \right )\), including the origin (0,0) and the observed end-point, with straight lines. The area under this plot is the empirical FROC AUC, denoted \(A_{\text{FROC}}\).

\hypertarget{empirical-origin-trivial-point}{%
\subsection{The origin, a trivial point}\label{empirical-origin-trivial-point}}

Since \(\zeta_{R_{FROC}+1} = \infty\) according to Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-NLFr} and Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-LLFr}, \(r = R_{FROC}+1\) yields the trivial operating point (0,0).

\hypertarget{empirical-end-point}{%
\subsection{The observed end-point and its semi-constrained property}\label{empirical-end-point}}

The abscissa of the observed end-point \(NLF_1\), is defined by:

\begin{equation}
\text{NLF}_1 = \frac{1}{K_1+K_2} \sum_{t=1}^{2} \sum_{k_t=1}^{K_t} \mathbb{I} \left ( N_{k_t t} \neq 0 \right ) \sum_{l_1=1}^{N_{k_t t}} \mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_t t l_1 1} \geq \zeta_1 \right ) 
\label{eq:empirical-NLF11}
\end{equation}

Since each case could have an arbitrary number of NLs, \(NLF_1\) need not equal unity, except fortuitously.

The ordinate of the observed end-point \(LLF_1\), is defined by:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
\text{LLF}_1 =& \frac{ \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}} \mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \geq  \zeta_1  \right ) }{L_T}\\
\leq& 1
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:empirical-LLF1a}
\end{equation}

The numerator is the total number of lesions that were actually marked. The ratio is the fraction of lesions that are marked, which is \(\leq 1\).

This is the \textbf{semi-constrained property of the observed end-point}, namely, while the observed end-point \emph{ordinate} is constrained to the range (0,1) the corresponding \emph{abscissa} is not so constrained.

\hypertarget{empirical-froc-plot-futility-extrapolation}{%
\subsection{Futility of extrapolation outside the observed end-point}\label{empirical-froc-plot-futility-extrapolation}}

To understand this consider the expression for \(NLF_0\), i.e., using Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-NLFr} with \(r = 0\):

\begin{equation}
\text{NLF}_0 = \frac{1}{K_1+K_2} \sum_{t=1}^{2} \sum_{k_t=1}^{K_t} \mathbb{I} \left ( N_{k_t t} \neq 0 \right ) \sum_{l_1=1}^{N_{k_t t}} \mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_t t l_1 1} \geq -\infty \right ) 
\end{equation}

The right hand side of this equation can be separated into two terms, the contribution of latent NLs with z-samples in the range \(z \geq \zeta_1\) and those in the range \(-\infty \leq z < \zeta_1\). The first term yields the abscissa of the observed end-point, Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-NLF11}. The 2nd term is:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned} 
\text{2nd term}=&\left (\frac{1}{K_1+K_2} \right )\sum_{t=1}^{2} \sum_{k_t=1}^{K_t} \mathbb{I} \left ( N_{k_t t} \neq 0 \right ) \sum_{l_1=1}^{N_{k_t t}} \mathbb{I} \left ( -\infty \leq z_{k_t t l_1 1} < \zeta_1 \right )\\
=&\frac{\text{unknown number}}{K_1+K_2}
\end{aligned}
\right \} 
\label{eq:empirical-NLF0a}
\end{equation}

It represents the contribution of unmarked NLs, i.e., latent NLs whose z-samples were below \(\zeta_1\). It determines how much further to the right the observer's NLF would have moved, relative to \(NLF_1\), if one could get the observer to lower the reporting criterion to \(-\infty\). \emph{Since the observer may not oblige, this term cannot, in general, be evaluated.} Therefore \(NLF_0\) cannot be evaluated. The basic problem is that \emph{unmarked latent NLs represent unobservable events}.

Turning our attention to \(LLF_0\):

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
\text{LLF}_0 =& \frac{ \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}} \mathbb{I} \left ( z_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \geq  -\infty  \right ) }{L_T}\\
=& 1
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:empirical-LLF0}
\end{equation}

Unlike unmarked latent NLs, **unmarked lesions can safely be assigned the \(-\infty\) rating, because an unmarked lesion is an observable event*. The right hand side of Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-LLF0} evaluates to unity. However, since the corresponding abscissa \(NLF_0\) is undefined, one cannot plot this point. It follows that one cannot extrapolate outside the observed end-point.

The formalism should not obscure the fact that the futility of extrapolation outside the observed end-point of the FROC is a fairly obvious property: one does not know how far to the right the abscissa of the observed end-point might extend if one could get the observer to report every latent NL.

The following code uses \texttt{dataset04} \citep{zanca2009evaluation} in the \texttt{RJafroc} package to illustrate an empirical FROC plot.

\hypertarget{empirical-ROC}{%
\section{The inferred-ROC plot}\label{empirical-ROC}}

By adopting a rational rule for converting the mark-rating data per case to a single rating per case, and commonly the highest rating rule is used \footnote{The highest rating method was used in early FROC modeling in \citep{bunch1977free} and in \citep{swensson1996unified}, the latter in the context of LROC paradigm modeling.}, it is possible to infer ROC data from FROC mark-rating data.

\hypertarget{the-inferred-roc-rating}{%
\subsection{The inferred-ROC rating}\label{the-inferred-roc-rating}}

The rating of the highest rated mark in a case, or \(-\infty\) if the case has no marks, is defined as the inferred-ROC rating for the case. Inferred-ROC ratings on non-diseased cases are referred to as inferred-FP ratings and those on diseased cases as inferred-TP ratings.

When there is little possibility for confusion, the prefix ``inferred'' is suppressed. Using the by now familiar cumulation procedure, FP counts are cumulated to calculate FPF and likewise TP counts are cumulated to calculate TPF.

Definitions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(FPF(\zeta)\) = cumulated inferred FP counts with z-sample \(\geq\) threshold \(\zeta\) divided by total number of non-diseased cases.
\item
  \(TPF(\zeta)\) = cumulated inferred TP counts with z-sample \(\geq\) threshold \(\zeta\) divided by total number of diseased cases
\end{itemize}

Definition of ROC plot:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The ROC is the plot of inferred \(TPF(\zeta)\) vs.~inferred \(FPF(\zeta)\).
\item
  \emph{The plot includes a straight line extension from the observed end-point to (1,1)}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{inferred-fpf}{%
\subsection{Inferred FPF}\label{inferred-fpf}}

The highest z-sample ROC false positive (FP) rating for non-diseased case \(k_1 1\) is defined by:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
FP_{k_1 1}=&\max_{l1} \left ( z_{k_1 1 l_1 1 } \mid l_1 \neq \varnothing \right ) \\
=& -\infty \mid l_1 = \varnothing  
 \end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:empirical-FP}
\end{equation}

If the case has at least one latent NL mark, then \(l_1 \neq \varnothing\), where \(\varnothing\) is the null set, and the first definition applies. If the case has no latent NL marks, then \(l_1 = \varnothing\), and the second definition applies. \(FP_{k_1 1}\) is the maximum z-sample over all latent marks occurring on non-diseased case \(k_1 1\), or \(-\infty\) if the case has no latent marks (this is allowed because a non-diseased case with no marks is an observable event). The corresponding false positive fraction is defined by:

\begin{equation}
\text{FPF}_r \equiv \text{FPF} \left ( \zeta_r \right ) = \frac{1}{K_1} \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \mathbb{I} \left ( FP_{k_1 1} \geq \zeta_r\right )
\label{eq:empirical-fpf}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{inferred-tpf}{%
\subsection{Inferred TPF}\label{inferred-tpf}}

The inferred true positive (TP) z-sample for diseased case \(k_2 2\) is defined by:

\begin{equation}
TP_{k_2 2} = \text{max}_{l_1 l_2}\left ( z_{k_2 2 l_1 1} ,z_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \mid l_1 \neq \varnothing \right )
\label{eq:empirical-TP1}
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
TP_{k_2 2} = \max_{l_2}  \left ( z_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \mid\left ( l_1 = \varnothing \land \left (\max_{l_2}{\left (z_{k_2 2 l_2 2}  \right )} \neq -\infty  \right )  \right ) \right ) 
\label{eq:empirical-TP2}
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
TP_{k_2 2} = = -\infty \mid \left ( l_1 = \varnothing \land\left ( \max_{l_2}{\left (z_{k_2 2 l_2 2}  \right )} = -\infty  \right )  \right )
\label{eq:empirical-TP3}
\end{equation}

Here \(\land\) is the logical AND operator. An explanation is in order. Consider Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-TP1}. There are two z-samples inside the \(\text{max}\) operator: \(z_{k_2 2 l_1 1} ,z_{k_2 2 l_2 2}\). The first z-sample is from a NL on a diseased case, as per the \(l_1 1\) subscripts, while the second is from a LL on the same diseased case, as per the \(l_2 2\) subscripts.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(l_1 \neq \varnothing\) then Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-TP1} applies, i.e., one takes the maximum over all z-samples, NLs and LLs, whichever is higher, on the diseased case.
\item
  If \(l_1 = \varnothing\) and at least one lesion is marked, then Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-TP2} applies, i.e., one takes the maximum z-sample over all marked LLs.
\item
  If \(l_1 = \varnothing\) and no lesions are marked, then Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-TP3} applies; this represents an unmarked diseased case; the \(-\infty\) rating assignment is justified because an unmarked diseased case is an observable event.
\end{itemize}

The inferred true positive fraction \(\text{TPF}_r\) is defined by:

\begin{equation}
\text{TPF}_r \equiv \text{TPF}(\zeta_r) = \frac{1}{K_2}\sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( TP_{k_2 2} \geq \zeta_r \right )

Since \(\zeta_{R_{FROC}+1} = \infty\), according to Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-LLFr} and Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf}, \(r = R_{FROC}+1\) yields the trivial operating point (0,0). Likewise, since \(\zeta_0 = -\infty\), \(r = 0\) yields the trivial point (1,1):

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned} 
\text{FPF}_{R_{FROC}+1} =& \frac{1}{K_1} \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \mathbb{I} \left ( FP_{k_1 1} \geq \infty \right )\\
=& 0\\
\text{LLF}_{R_{FROC}+1} =& \frac{1}{L_T} \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}\mathbb{I} \left ( LL_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \geq \infty \right )\\
=& 0
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:empirical-fpf-LLF-last}
\end{equation}

and

\text{FPF}_0 =& \frac{1}{K_1} \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \mathbb{I} \left ( FP_{k_1 1} \geq -\infty \right )\\
=& 1\\
\text{LLF}_0 =& \frac{1}{L_T} \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}\mathbb{I} \left ( LL_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \geq -\infty \right )\\
=& 1
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:empirical-fpf0-LLF0}
\end{equation}

Because every non-diseased case is assigned a rating, and is therefore counted, the right hand side of the first equation in \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf0-LLF0} evaluates to unity. This is obvious for marked cases. Since each unmarked case also gets a rating, albeit a \(-\infty\) rating, it is also counted (the argument of the indicator function in Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf0-LLF0} is true even when the inferred-FP rating is \(-\infty\)).

\section{The weighted-AFROC plot (wAFROC) plot}\label{empirical-wAFROC}}

The AFROC ordinate defined in Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-LLFr} gives equal importance to every lesion in a case. Therefore, a case with more lesions will have more influence on the AFROC (see next section for an explicit demonstration of this fact). This is undesirable since each case (i.e., patient) should get equal importance in the analysis -- as with ROC analysis, one wishes to draw conclusions about the population of cases and each case is an equally valid sample from the population. In particular, one does not want the analysis to be skewed towards cases with greater numbers of lesions. \footnote{Historical note: I became aware of how serious this issue could be when a researcher contacted me about using FROC methodology for nuclear medicine bone scan images, where the number of lesions on diseased cases can vary from a few to a hundred!}

Another issue is that the AFROC assigns equal \emph{clinical} importance to each lesion in a case. Lesion weights were introduced \citep{RN1385} to allow for the possibility that the clinical importance of finding a lesion might be lesion-dependent \citep{RN1966}. For example, it is possible that a diseased cases has lesions of two types with differing clinical importance; the figure-of-merit should give more credit to finding the more clinically important one. Clinical importance could be defined as the mortality associated with the specific lesion type; these can be obtained from epidemiological studies \citep{desantis2011breast}.

Let \(W_{k_2 l_2} \geq 0\) denote the \emph{weight} (i.e., short for clinical importance) of lesion \(l_2\) in diseased case \(k_2\) (since weights are only applicable to diseased cases one can, without ambiguity, drop the case-level and location-level truth subscripts, i.e., the notation \(W_{k_2 2 l_2 2}\) would be superfluous). For each diseased case \(k_2 2\) the weights are subject to the constraint:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{l_2 =1 }^{L_{k_2 2}} W_{k_2 l_2} = 1
\label{eq:empirical-weights-constraint}
\end{equation}

The constraint assures that the each diseased case exerts equal importance in determining the weighted-AFROC (wAFROC) operating characteristic, regardless of the number of lesions in it (see TBA Chapter 14 for a demonstration of this fact).

The weighted lesion localization fraction \(\text{wLLF}_r\) is defined by \citep{RN2484}:

\begin{equation}
\text{wLLF}_r \equiv \text{wLLF}\left ( \zeta_r \right ) = \frac{1}{K_2}\sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_r \right )
\label{eq:empirical-wLLFr}

\section{The AFROC1 plot}\label{empirical-AFROC1}}

Historically the AFROC originally used a different definition of FPF, which is retrospectively termed the AFROC1 plot. Since NLs can occur on diseased cases, it is possible to define an inferred-``FP'' rating on a \emph{diseased case} as the maximum of all NL ratings on the case, or \(-\infty\) if the case has no NLs. The quotes emphasize that this is non-standard usage of ROC terminology: in an ROC study, a FP can only occur on a \emph{non-diseased case}. Since both case-level truth states are allowed, the highest false positive (FP) z-sample for case \(k_t t\) is {[}the ``1'' superscript below is necessary to distinguish it from Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-FP}{]}:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
FP_{k_t t}^1 =& \max_{l_1} \left ( z_{k_t t l_1 1 } \mid  l_1 \neq \varnothing \right )\\
=& -\infty \mid l_1 = \varnothing
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:empirical-FP1}
\end{equation}

\(FP_{k_t t}^1\) is the maximum over all latent NL marks, labeled by the location index \(l_1\), occurring in case \(k_t t\), or \(-\infty\) if \(l_1 = \varnothing\). The corresponding false positive fraction \(FPF_r^1\) is defined by {[}the ``1'' superscript is necessary to distinguish it from Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf}{]}:

\begin{equation}
FPF_r^1 \equiv FPF_r^1\left ( \zeta_r \right ) = \frac{1}{K_1+K_2}\sum_{t=1}^{2}\sum_{k_t=1}^{K_t} \mathbb{I}\left ( FP_{k_t t}^1 \geq \zeta_r \right )
\label{eq:empirical-fpf1}
\end{equation}

Note the subtle differences between Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf} and Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf1}. The latter counts ``FPs'' on non-diseased and diseased cases while Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf} counts FPs on non-diseased cases only, and for that reason the denominators in the two equations are different. The advisability of allowing a diseased case to be both a TP and a FP is questionable from both clinical and statistical considerations. However, this operating characteristic can be useful in applications where all or almost all cases are diseased.

\section{Plots of FROC, AFROC and wAFROC AUCs vs.~ROC AUC}\label{empirical-plots}}

Plots of \(A_{\text{FROC}}\), \(A_{\text{AFROC}}\) and \(A_{\text{wAFROC}}\) vs.~\(A_{\text{ROC}}\) were generated for the dataset used in the previous illustrations.

The following is the plot of \(A_{\text{FROC}}\) vs.~\(A_{\text{ROC}}\). There are 20 points on the plot corresponding to 5 treatments and 4 readers. The straight line is a least squares fit. \(A_{\text{ROC}}\) is assumed to be the gold standard. Note the poor correlation between \(A_{\text{FROC}}\) and \(A_{\text{ROC}}\). The slope is negative and there is much scatter.

\includegraphics{03-empirical_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-19-1.pdf}

Evidently \(A_{\text{FROC}}\) does not correlate well with \(A_{\text{ROC}}\). The reason should be fairly obvious. The FROC is unconstrained in the NLF direction and the area under the plot rewards an observer who generates more and more NLs while not generating more LLs, i.e., as the operating point moves further to the right along the flat part of the plot. In fact the perfect observer, Section \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(froc-paradigm-solar-analogy)}, whose FROC plot is the vertical line connecting (0,0) and (0,1) has zero \(A_{\text{FROC}}\)! One can try ot avoid this problem by limiting the area under the FROC to that between \(\text{NLF} = 0\) and \(\text{NLF} = x\) where \(x\) is some arbitrarily chosen fixed value -- indeed this procedure has been used by many CAD algorithm designers. Since the choice of \(x\) is arbitrary the procedure would be subjective and totally dependent on the algorithm designer. Moreover it would not solve the problem that the perfect observer would still yield \(A_{\text{FROC}} = 0\). The perfect observer problem is not academic as the method would fail for any observer with \(\text{NLF}_{max} < x\). For such an observer the partial area would be undefined. This would force the algorithm designer to chose \(x\) as the minimum of all \(\text{NLF}_{max}\) values over all observers and treatments, which would exclude a lot of data from the analysis leading to a severe statistical power penalty.

The basic problem is that the FROC plot is unconstrained in the NLF direction.

The following is the plot of \(A_{\text{AFROC}}\) vs.~\(A_{\text{ROC}}\). This time there is a strong positive correlation between the two. The reason is that the AFROC is fully contained in the unit square. An observer who generates more NL marks would in fact yield smaller \(A_{\text{AFROC}}\) - this is explained in a later section TBA .

\includegraphics{03-empirical_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-20-1.pdf}

The following is the plot of \(A_{\text{wAFROC}}\) vs.~\(A_{\text{ROC}}\). Again, there is a strong positive correlation between the two. The wAFROC is also fully contained in the unit square.

\hypertarget{empirical-numerical-illustration}{%
\section{AFROC vs.~wAFROC}\label{empirical-numerical-illustration}}

The wAFROC and AFROC, particularly the concept that the wAFROC gives equal importance to each diseased case while the AFROC gives more important to diseased cases with more lesions, are perhaps best illustrated with a numerical example. The dataset consists of \(K_1 = 4\) non-diseased and \(K_2 = 4\) diseased cases. The first two diseased cases have one lesion each, and the remaining two have two lesions each.

Shown next is the \texttt{NL} ratings array which has 8 rows, corresponding to the total number of cases, and 2 columns, corresponding to the maximum number of NLs and LLs per case (notice there are two entries for case \#3). The negative infinities represent unmarked locations.

\begin{verbatim}
#> 
#> NL ratings:
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,] -Inf -Inf
#> [2,]  0.5 -Inf
#> [3,]  0.7  0.6
#> [4,] -0.3 -Inf
#> [5,]  1.5 -Inf
#> [6,] -Inf -Inf
#> [7,] -Inf -Inf
#> [8,] -Inf -Inf
\end{verbatim}

Shown next is the \texttt{FP} ratings array. Since FPs are only possible on non-diseased cases, this is a length 4 row-vector. Each value is the maximum of the two \texttt{NL} ratings for the corresponding non-diseased case. As an example, for case \#3 the maximum of the two \texttt{NL} values is 0.7.

\begin{verbatim}
#> 
#> FP ratings:
#> [1] -Inf  0.5  0.7 -0.3
\end{verbatim}

Show next is the sorted \texttt{FP} ratings.

\begin{verbatim}
#> [1] -Inf -0.3  0.5  0.7
\end{verbatim}

The sorting makes it easy to construct the \texttt{FPF} values, shown next.

\begin{verbatim}
#> 
#> FPF values:
#>  0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.250 0.500 0.500 0.750 1.000
\end{verbatim}

The first non-zero \texttt{FPF} value is 0.25, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past the highest \texttt{FP} value, namely 0.7. The 0.25 comes from 1 \texttt{FP} case divided by 4 non-diseased cases. The next \texttt{FPF} value is 0.5, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past the next-highest \texttt{FP} value, namely 0.5. The 0.5 comes from 2 divided by 4. The next \texttt{FPF} value is 0.75 and the last \texttt{FPF} value is unity.

Shown next is the \texttt{LL} ratings array:

\begin{verbatim}
#> 
#> LL ratings:
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]  0.9 -Inf
#> [2,] -0.2 -Inf
#> [3,]  1.6 -Inf
#> [4,]  3.0    2
\end{verbatim}

Show next is the sorted \texttt{LL} ratings.

\begin{verbatim}
#> [1] -Inf -Inf -Inf -0.2  0.9  1.6  2.0  3.0
\end{verbatim}

The sorting makes it easy to construct the \texttt{LLF} values, shown next.

\begin{verbatim}
#> 
#> LLF values:
#>  0.000 0.167 0.333 0.500 0.667 0.667 0.667 0.833 0.833 1.000
\end{verbatim}

The first non-zero \texttt{LLF} value is 0.167, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past the highest \texttt{LL} value, namely 3. The 0.167 comes from 1 LL divided by 6 lesions. The next \texttt{LLF} value is 0.333, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past the next-highest \texttt{LL} value, namely 2 (2/6 = 0.333). The next \texttt{LLF} value is 0.5, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past 1.6 (3/6 = 0.5), and so on.

Show next is the lesion weights array:

\begin{verbatim}
#> 
#> lesion weights:
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]  1.0 -Inf
#> [2,]  1.0 -Inf
#> [3,]  0.1  0.9
#> [4,]  0.9  0.1
\end{verbatim}

Since the first two diseased cases have one lesion each, the {[}1,1{]} and {[}2,1{]} elements of the the weight array are each equal to unity and the {[}1,2{]} and {[}2,2{]} elements are each equal to negative infinity, which is being used as a missing value. For diseased case \#3 the first lesion has weight 0.1 while the second lesion has weight 0.9 (the weights must sum to unity). For diseased case \#4 the weights are reversed.

The sorted \texttt{LL} ratings array and the weights are used to construct the \texttt{wLLF} values shown next.

\begin{verbatim}
#> 
#> wLLF values:
#>  0.000 0.225 0.250 0.275 0.525 0.525 0.525 0.775 0.775 1.000
\end{verbatim}

The first non-zero \texttt{wLLF} value is 0.225, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past the highest \texttt{LL} value, namely 3. Since this comes from the first lesion on diseased case \#4, whose weight is 0.9, the corresponding incremental vertical jump is 1 divided by 4 (\emph{sic}) times 0.9. Notice that we are dividing by 4, the total number of diseased cases, not 6 as in the \texttt{LLF} example.

The next \texttt{wLLF} value is 0.25, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past the next-highest \texttt{LL} value, namely 2, which comes from the 2nd lesion on the fourth diseased case with weight 0.1. The incremental jump in \texttt{wLLF} is 1 divided by 4 times 0.1, which is 0.025. The net \texttt{wLLF} value corresponding to these two lesions is \(1/4*0.9 + 1/4*0.1 = 1/4 = 0.25\). The two lesions on diseased case \#4 contribute 0.25 in \texttt{wLLF} increment. In contrast, they contribute \(2/6 = 0.333\) in \texttt{LLF} increment, showing explicitly that the AFROC gives greater importance to diseased cases with more lesions while the wAFROC does not.

The next \texttt{wLLF} value is 0.275, which occurs when the sliding threshold is lowered past 1.6, which ratings comes from the first lesion on diseased case \#3, with weight 0.1, \(1/4*0.9 + 1/4*0.1 + 1/4*0.1 = 0.275\), and so on.

The reader should complete these hand-calculations to reproduce all of the \texttt{wLLF} values shown above.

Shown in Fig. \ref{fig:plots-afrocPlot-wafrocPlot} are the empirical AFROC and wAFROC plots.

From the preceding it is seen that the AFROC-based trapezoidal plots consist of upward and rightward jumps, starting from the origin (0,0) and ending at (1,1). This is true regardless of whether the z-samples are binned or not: i.e., at the ``microscopic'' level the jumps always exist. Each upward jump is associated with a \texttt{LL} rating exceeding a virtual threshold. Each rightward jump is associated with a \texttt{FP} rating exceeding the threshold. Upward jumps tend to increase the area under the AFROC-based plots and rightward jumps tend to decrease it. This makes sense in terms of correct decisions being rewarded and incorrect ones being penalized, and can be seen from two examples. If there are only upward jumps, then the trapezoidal plot rises from the origin to (0,1), where all lesions are correctly localized without any generating FPs and performance is perfect -- the straight-line extension to (1,1) ensures that the net area is unity. If there are only horizontal jumps, that takes the operating point from the origin to (1,0), where none of the lesions are localized and every non-diseased image has at least one NL mark, representing worst possible performance. Here, despite the straight line extension to (1,1), the net area is zero.

\emph{The area under the AFROC is the probability that a lesion is rated higher than any mark on a non-diseased case.}

\emph{The area under the weighted-AFROC is lesion-weight adjusted probability that a lesion is rated higher than any mark on a non-diseased case.}

\section{TBA Discussion}\label{empirical-Discussion}}

TBA This chapter started with the difference between latent and actual marks and the notation to describe FROC data. The notation is used in deriving formulae for FROC, inferred-ROC, AFROC, wAFROC, AFROC1, wAFROC1 and EFROC operating characteristics. In each case an area measure was defined. With the exception of the FROC plot, all operating characteristics defined in this chapter are contained in the unit square. Discussion of the preferred operating characteristic is deferred to a subsequent chapter TBA.

FROC data consists of mark-rating pairs. In this chapter a distinction is made between latent and actual marks. This is followed by a table summarizing FROC notation. This is a key table which will be used in later chapters. Section \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(froc-paradigm-froc-plot)} introduced the empirical FROC plot. This chapter presents mathematical expressions for this and other empirical plots possible with FROC data: the inferred-ROC, the alternative FROC, the weighted alternative FROC, and others. Operating characteristics are \emph{visual} depicters of performance. Scalar quantities, typically area measures derived from operating characteristics, are \emph{quantitative} measures of performance, termed \emph{figures of merit} (FOMs). This chapter defines an area measure for each empirical operating characteristic. An FROC dataset is used to illustrate the plots and area measures. With the exception of the FROC, all empirical plots include a straight line extension from the observed end-point to (1,1). The correlation between the area measures is qualitatively examined via plots. It is shown that for this dataset the FROC area measure correlates poorly with that under the ROC curve, whereas the other measures correlate better. This is explained by the fact that, unlike the other measures, the FROC plot is not contained within the unit square.

\section{Appendix 1: Two Theorems}\label{empirical-two-theorems}}

The area \(\text{A}_{wAFROC}\) under the empirical wAFROC plot is obtained by summing the areas of individual trapezoids defined by drawing vertical lines from each pair of adjacent operating points to the x-axis. A sample plot is shown Fig. \ref{fig:empirical-theorems}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{03-empirical_files/figure-latex/empirical-theorems-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:empirical-theorems}An example wAFROC plot; from left to right, the two shaded areas correspond to \(A_i\) and \(A_0\), respectively, defined below.}
\end{figure}

The operating point labeled \(i\) has coordinates \(\left ( \text{FPF}_i, \text{wLLF}_i \right )\) given by Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf} and Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-wLLFr}.

\hypertarget{empirical-two-theorems-1}{%
\subsection{Theorem 1}\label{empirical-two-theorems-1}}

TBA The area \(A_{\text{wAFROC}}\) under the empirical wAFROC plot equals the weighted-AFROC FOM-statistic \(\theta_{\text{wAFROC}}\) defined by Eqn.\texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(eq:empirical-theta-wafroc)}:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{\text{wAFROC}} = A_{\text{wAFROC}}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem1}
\end{equation}

The area \(A_i\) of the leftmost shaded trapezoid in Fig. \ref{fig:empirical-theorems} is:

\begin{equation}
A_i = \frac{\left (\text{FPF}_i - \text{FPF}_{i+1}\right )\left (\text{wLLF}_i + \text{wLLF}_{i+1}\right )}{2}
\label{eq:empirical-auc-1}
\end{equation}

Then,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A_i =&  \frac{\left (\text{FPF}_i - \text{FPF}_{i+1}\right )}{2K_2} \times \\ 
& \left[ \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_i \right ) \right. \\
&+ \left. \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_{i+1} \right ) \right]  
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem2}
\end{equation}

Using the probabilistic relation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_i \right ) = \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_{i+1} \right ) + \mathbb{I}\left ( \zeta_{i} \leq z_{k_2 l_2 2} < \zeta_{i+1} \right )
\label{eq:empirical-appendix-1}
\end{equation}

we can expand the 1st term inside the square bracket:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A_i =&  \frac{\left (\text{FPF}_i - \text{FPF}_{i+1}\right )}{2K_2} \times \\ 
& \left[ \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( \zeta_{i} \leq z_{k_2 l_2 2} < \zeta_{i+1} \right ) \right. \\
&+ \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_{i+1} \right ) \\ 
&+ \left. \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_{i+1} \right ) \right]  
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The last two terms are equal, therefore:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
A_i =& \frac{\left (\text{FPF}_i - \text{FPF}_{i+1}\right )}{K_2} \times \\ 
& \left[ \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( \zeta_{i} \leq z_{k_2 l_2 2} < \zeta_{i+1} \right ) \right. \\
& +\left. \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2}\sum_{l_2=1}^{L_{k_2 2}}W_{k_2 l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_2 l_2 2} \geq \zeta_{i+1} \right ) \right]  
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem3}
\end{equation}

The final steps of the proof require that the z-samples be converted to integer ratings, which can be done without loss of ordering information if the number of bins is sufficiently large. Let \(r_{k_t t l_s s}\) denote the integer rating of mark \(k_t tl_s s\), which implies that marks with z-samples satisfying \(\zeta_i \leq z_{k_t l_s s} < \zeta_{i+1}\), where \(i=0,1,...R\) are rated \(i\). The dummy thresholds \(\zeta_0\) and \(\zeta_{R+1}\) are defined as \(-\infty\) and \(+\infty\), respectively. From Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-fpf} it follows that:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{FPF}_i - \text{FPF}_{i+1}=& \frac{1}{K_1} \left[ \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (z_{k_1 1 l_1 1}  \right ) \geq \zeta_i \right ) - \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \mathbb{I}\left ( z_{k_1 1 l_1 1} \geq \zeta_{i+1} \right ) \right] \\
=& \frac{1}{K_1} \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \mathbb{I}\left ( \zeta_i \leq \max_{l_1} \left (z_{k_1 1 l_1 1}  \right ) < \zeta_{i+1} \right ) 
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem4}
\end{equation}

Because of the binning rule, \(\mathbb{I}\left ( \zeta_i \leq \max_{l_1} \left (z_{k_1 1 l_1 1} \right ) < \zeta_{i+1} \right )\) can be replaced by \(\mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 1 l_1 1} \right ) = i \right )\), \(\mathbb{I}\left ( \zeta_i \leq z_{k_2 2l_22} < \zeta_{i+1} \right )\) can be replaced by \(\mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2l_22} = i \right )\) and \(\mathbb{I}\left (z_{k_2 2l_22} \geq \zeta_{i+1} \right )\) can be replaced by \(\mathbb{I}\left (r_{k_2 2l_22} > i \right )\). Then Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-theorem2} can be re-written as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{A}_i =& \frac{1}{K_1K_2}  \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{l_{k_2}}\sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \\
&\left [ \frac{1}{2} W_{k_2l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 1 l_1 1}  \right ) = i  \right )\mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2 l_2 2} = i\right ) \right. \\
+& \left. \mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 l_1 1}  \right ) = i  \right )\mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2 l_2 2} > i \right )  \right ]
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem5}
\end{equation}

Summing over all values of \(i\), one gets for the total area under the empirical wAFROC plot:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{A}_{wAFROC} =& \frac{1}{K_1K_2}  \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{l_{k_2}}\sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} W_{k_2l_2} \\
&\left [ \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2l_2 2} = \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 1l_1 1}  \right )  \right ) + \mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_22 l_2 2} > \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_11 l_1 1}  \right )  \right )  \right ]
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem6}
\end{equation}

Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-theorem5} follows from the property of the indicator function, which constrains \(i\) in the indicator functions inside the square bracket in Eqn. (17) to \(\text{max}_{l_1} \left ( r_{k_1 1 l_1 1} \right )\), where the functions are unity and otherwise they are zero. Using the definition of the Wilcoxon kernel function, TBA Eqn. (3), it follows that:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{A}_{wAFROC} =& \frac{1}{K_1K_2}  \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{l_{k_2}}\sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} W_{k_2l_2} \psi\left ( \text{max}_{l_1} \left ( r_{k_1 1 l_1 1} \right ) , r_{k_2 2 l_2 2} \right )
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem7}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{empirical-two-theorems-2}{%
\subsection{Theorem 2}\label{empirical-two-theorems-2}}

We prove a theorem that the contribution of the \(i = 0\) term in Eqn. TBA is identical to the area under the extension of the wAFROC from the uppermost non-trivial point to (1,1). According to Eqn. TBA,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{A}_0 =& \frac{1}{K_1K_2}  \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{l_{k_2}}\sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1} \\
&\left [ \frac{1}{2} W_{k_2l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 1 l_1 1}  \right ) = 0  \right )\mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2 l_2 2} = 0 \right ) \right. \\
+& \left. \mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 l_1 1}  \right ) = 0  \right )\mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2 l_2 2} > 0 \right )  \right ]
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem8}
\end{equation}

Rearranging the summations:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{A}_0 =& 
\left [ \frac{1}{2K_1} \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1}\mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 1 l_1 1}  \right ) = 0  \right ) \frac{1}{K_2} \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{l_{k_2}} W_{k_2l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2 l_2 2} = 0 \right ) \right. \\
&+ \left. \frac{1}{K_1} \sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1}\mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 l_1 1}  \right ) = 0  \right ) \frac{1}{K_2} \sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{l_{k_2}} W_{k_2l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2 l_2 2} > 0 \right )  \right ]
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem9}
\end{equation}

Because the indicator function and the summation symbol counts the numbers of unmarked (zero rated) non-diseased cases and the division by \(K_1\) yields the corresponding contribution to \(\text{FPF}\), which is the complement of the largest \(\text{FPF}\) value, \(\text{FPF}_1\), obtained by cumulating all ratings 1 and above it follows that:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{K_1}\sum_{k_1=1}^{K_1}\mathbb{I}\left ( \max_{l_1} \left (r_{k_1 1 l_1 1}  \right ) = 0  \right ) = 1 - \text{FPF}_1
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem10}
\end{equation}

Similarly,

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{K_2}\sum_{k_2=1}^{K_2} \sum_{l_2=1}^{l_{k_2}} W_{k_2l_2} \mathbb{I}\left ( r_{k_2 2 l_2 2}  = 0  \right ) = 1 - \text{wLLF}_1
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem11}
\end{equation}

Using these expressions, Eqn. TBA reduces to:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{A}_0 = \frac{\left ( 1-\text{FPF}_1 \right ) \left ( 1+\text{wLLF}_1 \right )}{2}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-theorem12}
\end{equation}

This is seen to be the area of a rectangle of base \(\left ( 1-\text{FPF}_1 \right )\) and height \(\text{wLLF}_1\) plus the area of a triangle of base \(\left ( 1-\text{FPF}_1 \right )\) and height \(1-\text{wLLF}_1\). In other words it is the area under the extension of the wAFROC from the uppermost non-trivial point to (1,1).

The area \(A_0\) under the straight-line extension of the wAFROC from the observed end-point \(\left ( \text{FPF}_1, \text{wLLF}_1 \right )\) to (1,1) is given by:

\begin{equation}
A_0 = \frac{\left ( 1 - \text{FPF}_1 \right )\left ( 1 + \text{wLLF}_1 \right )}{2}
\label{eq:empirical-A0}
\end{equation}

According to Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-A0}, \(A_0\) increases as \(\text{FPF}_1\) decreases, i.e., as more non-diseased cases are \emph{not marked} and as \(\text{wLLF}_1\) increases, i.e., as more lesions, especially those with greater weights, \emph{are marked}. Both observations are in keeping with the behavior of a valid FOM.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Failure to include the area under the straight-line extension results in not counting the full positive contribution to the FOM of unmarked non-diseased cases and marked lesions.
\item
  Each unmarked non-diseased case represents a perfect decision.
\item
  For a perfect observer whose operating characteristic is the vertical line from (0,0) to (0,1) followed by the horizontal line from (0,1) to (1,1), \emph{the area under the straight-line extension comprises the entire AUC}. Excluding it would yield zero AUC for a perfect observer, which is obviously incorrect.
\item
  Stated equivalently, for the perfect observer \(\text{FPF}_1 = 0\) and \(\text{wLLF}_1 = 1\) and then, according to Eqn. \eqref{eq:empirical-A0}, the area under the straight line extension is \(A_0 = 1\).

\right]
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:empirical-computational-froc}
\end{equation}

\(z_{k_11l_11}'\) denotes a \emph{finite} NL z-sample. This notation is used to eliminate the negative infinities due to unmarked NLs which are not observable events. This notation is not needed for LLs since unmarked LLs are observable events. The first double summation inside the square bracket compares, using the \(\psi\) function, all finite NL ratings on \emph{non-diseased} cases with all lesion ratings on diseased case \(k_22\). The second double summation compares all finite NL ratings on \emph{diseased cases} with all lesion ratings on diseased case \(k_22\). The double summation outside the square bracket sums over all diseased cases \(k_22\) and all lesions in each diseased case. The final value is divided by the total number of cases and the total number of lesions.

The formula can be simplified by making two arrays, the first containing all finite NL ratings and the second, with length equal to the total number of lesions, containing all lesion ratings, including unmarked lesions. One compares, using the \(\psi\) function, the NL and LL ratings in the two arrays and divides by the total number of cases and by the total number of lesions.

The following example uses the same 8-case FROC dataset used earlier. This time the FROC plot is shown and the AUC is calculated two ways: using geometry and using the formula (implemented in \texttt{RJafroc} function \texttt{UtilFigureOfMerit}).

The FOM-statistic \(\text{A}_{AFROC}\) achieves its highest value, unity, if and only if every lesion is rated higher than any mark on non-diseased cases, for then the \(\psi\) function always yields unity, and the summations yield unity. If, on the other hand, every lesion is rated lower than every mark on every non-diseased case, the \(\psi\) function always yields zero, and the FOM-statistic is zero. Therefore, \(0 \leq \text{A}_{AFROC} \leq 1\).
This shows that \(\text{A}_{AFROC}\) behaves like a probability but its range is \emph{twice} that of \(\text{A}_{ROC}\); recall that \(0.5 \leq \text{A}_{ROC} \leq 1\) (assuming the observer has equal or better than random performance and the observer does not have the direction of the rating scale accidentally reversed). This has the consequence that treatment related differences between \(\text{A}_{AFROC}\) (i.e., effect sizes) are larger relative to the corresponding ROC effect sizes (just as temperature differences in the Fahrenheit scale are larger than the same differences expressed in the Celsius scale). This has important implications for FROC sample size estimation, see \texttt{RJafrocQuickStart} Chapter TBA.

The range \(0 \leq \text{A}_{AFROC} \leq 1\) is one reason why the ``chance diagonal'' of the AFROC, corresponding to \(\text{A}_{AFROC} = 0.5\), does \emph{not} reflect chance-level performance. \(\text{A}_{AFROC} = 0.5\) is actually reasonable performance, being exactly in the middle of the allowed range. An example of this was given in TBA §13.4.2.2 for the case of an expert radiologist who does not mark any cases.

In the second term inside the square brackets, notice the need to distinguish between the two indices for diseased cases \(z_{k_22l_11}'\) and \(z_{k_22l_22}\).

\section{Introduction}\label{visual-search-intro}}

To understand free-response data, specifically how radiologists interpret images, one must come to grips with visual search. Casual usage of everyday terms like ``search'', ``recognition'' and ``detection'' in specific scientific contexts can lead to confusion.
\emph{Visual search is defined in a broad sense as grouping and labeling parts of an image.}

A schema of how radiologists find perform the search task, termed the Kundel-Nodine search model is described. The importance of this major conceptual model is not widely appreciated by researchers. It is the basis of the radiological search model (RSM) described in a later chapter TBA.

The following sections draw heavily on work by Nodine and Kundel \citep{nodine1987using, kundel2007holistic, kundel2004modeling, kundel1983visual, kundel1978visual}. The author acknowledges critical insights gained through conversations with Dr.~Claudia Mello-Thoms.

\section{Grouping and labeling ROIs}\label{visual-search-grouping-labeling-rois}}

Looking at and understanding an image involves grouping and assigning labels to different regions of interest (ROIs) in the image, where the labels correspond to entities that exist (or have existed in the examples to follow) in the real world. As an example, if one looks at Fig. \ref{fig:visual-search-us-presidents}, one would label them (from left to right and top to bottom, in raster fashion): Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and the presidential seal. The accuracy of the labeling depends on prior-knowledge, i.e., expertise, of the observer. If one were ignorant about US presidents one would be unable to correctly label them.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/15-visual-search/usPresidents} 

}

\caption{This image consists of 8 sub-images or ROIs. Understanding an image involves grouping and assigning labels to different ROIs, where the labels correspond to entities that exist in the real world. One familiar with US history would label them, from left to right and top to bottom, in raster fashion, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. Bush and the presidential seal. Labeling accuracy depends on expertise of the observer. The row and column index of each ROI identifies its location.}\label{fig:visual-search-us-presidents}
\end{figure}

Image interpretation in radiology is not fundamentally different. It involves assigning labels to an image by grouping and recognizing areas of the image that have correspondences to the radiologist's knowledge of the underlying anatomy, and, most importantly, deviations from the underlying anatomy. Most doctors, who need not be radiologists, can look at a chest x-ray and say, ``this is the heart'', ``this is a rib'', ``this is a clavicle'', ``this is the aortic arch'', etc., the top image in Fig. \ref{fig:visual-search-chest-images}. This is because they know the underlying anatomy, the bottom image in Fig. \ref{fig:visual-search-chest-images} and have a basic understanding of the x-ray image formation physics that relates the anatomy to the image.

\hypertarget{visual-search-recognition-detection}{%
\section{Recognition vs.~detection}\label{visual-search-recognition-detection}}

The process of grouping and labeling parts of an image is termed recognition. This was illustrated with the pictures of the US presidents, Fig. \ref{fig:visual-search-us-presidents}. Recognition is distinct from detection, which is deciding about the presence of something that is unexpected or the absence of something that is expected, in other words, a deviation, in either direction, from what is expected. An example of detecting the presence of something that is unexpected would be a lung nodule and an example of detecting the absence of something that is expected would be an image of a patient with a missing rib (yes, it does occur, even excluding the biblical Adam).

The terms ``expected'' and ``unexpected'' are important: they imply expertise dependent expectations regarding the true structure of the non-diseased image, which I term a non-diseased template, and therefore an ability to recognize clinically relevant deviations or perturbations, in either direction, from this template; e.g., a lung nodule that could be cancer. By ``clinically relevant'' I mean perturbations related to the patient's health outcome -- recognizing scratches, dead pixels, artifacts of know origin, and lead patient ID markers, do not count. There is a location associated with recognition, but not with detection. Detection is the presence or absence of something, i.e., the perturbation, which could be anywhere. For example, in Fig. \ref{fig:visual-search-us-presidents}, recognizing a face is equivalent to assigning a row and column index in the image. Specifically, recognizing of George H.W. Bush implies pointing to row = two and column = three. Detecting George H.W. Bush implies stating that George H.W. Bush is present in the image, but the location could be in any of the eight locations. Recognition is an FROC paradigm task, while detection is an ROC paradigm task. Instead of recognition, I prefer the more clinical term ``finding'', as in ``finding'' a lesion.

\hypertarget{visual-search-search-classification}{%
\section{TBA Search vs.~classification}\label{visual-search-search-classification}}

Since template perturbations can occur at different locations in the images, the ability to selectively recognize them is related to search expertise. The term ``selectively'' is important: a non-expert can trivially recognize all perturbations by claiming all regions in the image are perturbed. Search expertise is the selective ability to find clinically relevant perturbations that are actually present while minimizing finding what appear to be clinically relevant perturbations but which are actually not present. In FROC terminology, search expertise is the ability to find latent LLs while minimizing the numbers of found latent NLs. Lesion-classification expertise is the ability to correctly classify a found suspicious region as malignant or benign.

The skills required to recognize a nodule in a chest x-ray are different from that required to recognize a low-contrast circular or Gaussian shaped artificial nodule against a background of random noise. In the former instance the skills of the radiologist are relevant: e.g., the skilled radiologist knows not to confuse a blood vessel viewed ``end on'' for a nodule, especially since the radiologist knows where to expect these vessels, e.g., the aorta. In the latter instance, (i.e., viewing artificial nodules superposed on random noise) there are no expected anatomic structures, so the skills possessed by the radiologist are nullified. This is the reason why having radiologists interpret random noise images and pretending that this somehow makes it ``clinically relevant'' is a waste of reader resources and represent bad science. One might as well used undergraduates with good eyesight, motivation and training. To quote \citep{nodine1987using}

\begin{quote}
Detecting an object that is hidden in a natural scene is not the same as detecting an object displayed against a background of random noise.
\end{quote}

This paragraph also argues against usage of phantoms as stand-ins for clinical images for ``clinical'' performance assessment. Phantoms are fine in the quality control context, but they do not allow radiologists the opportunity to exercise their professional skills.

\hypertarget{visual-search-kundel-nodine-model}{%
\section{The Kundel - Nodine search model}\label{visual-search-kundel-nodine-model}}

The Kundel-Nodine model \citep{kundel2007holistic, kundel2004modeling} is a schema of events that occur from the radiologist's first glance to the decision about the image.

Assuming the task has been defined prior to viewing, based on eye-tracking recordings obtained on radiologists while they interpreted images, Kundel and Nodine proposed the following schema for the diagnostic interpretation process, consisting of two major components: (1) glancing or global impression and (2) scanning or feature analysis:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/15-visual-search/kundel-nodine} 

}

\caption{The Kundel-Nodine model of radiological search. The glancing/global stage identifies perturbations from the template of a generic non-diseased case. The scanning stage analyzes the each perturbation and calculates the probability it is a true lesion. Only perturbations with sufficiently high probability are marked.}\label{fig:visual-search-kundel-nodine}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{visual-search-glancing-global-impression}{%
\subsection{Glancing / Global impression}\label{visual-search-glancing-global-impression}}

The colloquial term ``glancing'' is meant literally. The glance is brief, typically lasting about 100 - 300 ms, too short for detailed foveal examination and interpretation. Instead, during this brief interval peripheral vision and reader expertise are the primary mechanisms responsible for the identification of the perturbations. The glance results in a global impression, or gestalt, that identifies perturbations from the template. Object recognition occurs at a holistic level, i.e., in the context of the whole image, as there is insufficient time for detailed viewing and all of this is going on using peripheral vision. It is remarkable that radiologists can make reasonably accurate interpretations from information obtained in a brief glance, see Fig. 6 in \citep{nodine1987using}. Perturbations are flagged for subsequent detailed viewing, i.e., the initial glance tells the visual system where to look more closely.

\hypertarget{visual-search-scanning-local-feature-analysis}{%
\subsection{Scanning / Local feature analysis}\label{visual-search-scanning-local-feature-analysis}}

The global impression identifies perturbations for detailed foveal viewing by the central vision. During this process - termed scanning or feature analysis - the observer scrutinizes and analyzes the suspicious regions for evidence of possible disease. In principle, they calculate the probability of malignancy. For those readers of this book familiar with how CAD works, this corresponds to the feature analysis stage of CAD where regions found by the global search, termed \emph{initial detections} in the CAD literature, are analyzed for probability of malignancy.

The essential point that emerges is that decisions are made at a finite, relatively small, number of regions. Attention units are not uniformly distributed through the image in raster-scan fashion; rather the global impression identifies a smaller set of regions that require detailed scanning.

Eye-tracker recordings for a two-view digital mammogram for two observers are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:visual-search-eye-tracking}, for an inexperienced observer (upper two panels) and an expert mammographer (lower two panels). The small circles indicate individual fixations (dwell time \textasciitilde{} 100 ms). The larger high-contrast circles indicate clustered fixations (cumulative dwell time \textasciitilde{} 1 s). The larger low-contrast circles indicate a mass visible on both views. The inexperienced observer finds many more suspicious regions than does the expert mammographer but misses the lesion in the MLO view. In other words, the inexperienced observer generates many latent NLs but only one latent LL. The mammographer finds the lesion in the MLO view, which qualifies as a latent LL, without finding suspicious regions in the non-diseased parenchyma, i.e., the expert generated zero latent NLs on this case and one latent LL. It is possible the observer was so confident in the malignancy found in the MLO view that there was no need to fixate the visible lesion in the other view - the decision had already been made to recall the patient for further imaging.

\textbf{Details:} Eye-tracking recordings for a two-view digital mammogram display for two observers, an inexperienced observer (upper two panels) and an expert mammographer (lower two panels). The small circles indicate individual fixations (dwell time \textasciitilde{} 100 ms). The larger high-contrast circles indicate clustered fixations (cumulative dwell time \textasciitilde{} 1 sec). The latter correspond to the latent marks in the search-model. The larger low-contrast circles indicate a mass visible on both views. The inexperienced observer finds many more suspicious regions than does the expert mammographer but misses the lesion in the MLO view. In other words the inexperienced observer generates many latent NLs but only one latent LL.

It is possible the observer was so confident in the malignancy found in the MLO view that there was no need to fixate the visible lesion in the other view - the decision had already been made to recall the patient for further imaging, which confirmed the finding.

\hypertarget{visual-search-Kundel-Nodine-model-CAD}{%
\section{Kundel-Nodine model and CAD algorithms}\label{visual-search-Kundel-Nodine-model-CAD}}

It turns out that the designers of CAD algorithms independently arrived at a two-stage process remarkably similar to that described by Kundel-Nodine for radiologist observers. CAD algorithms are designed to emulate expert radiologists, and while this goal is not yet met, these algorithms are reasonable approximations to radiologists, and include the critical elements of search and localization that are central to clinical tasks. CAD algorithms involve two steps analogous to the holistic and cognitive stages of the Kundel-Nodine visual search model \citep{nodine1987using, kundel2004modeling, kundel1983visual}. In other words, CAD has a perceptual correspondence to human observers that to my knowledge is not shared by other method of predicting what radiologists will call on clinical images.

In the first stage of CAD, termed initial detections \citep{edwards2002maximum}, the algorithm finds ``all reasonable'' regions that could possibly be a malignancy. The term ``all reasonable'' is used because an irrational observer could trivially ``find'' every malignancy by marking all regions of the image. Most of these regions would be unreasonable to a rational observer, who would prefentially marks lesions while minimizing marking other regions. Therefore, the idea of CAD's initial detection stage is to find as many of the malignancies as possible while not finding too many non-diseased regions. This corresponds to the search stage of the Kundel-Nodine model. Unfortunately, CAD is rather poor at this task compared to expert radiologists. Progress in this area has been stymied by lack of understanding of search and how to measure performance in the FROC task. Indeed a widely held misconception is that CAD is perfect (!) at search, because it ``looks at'' everything (Dr.~Ron Summers, NIH, private communication, Dublin, ca. 2010). In giving equal attention units to all parts of the image, CAD will trivially find all cancers, but it will also find a large number of NLs.

CAD researchers are, in my opinion, at the forefront of those presuming to understand how radiologists interpret cases. They work with real images and real lesions and the manufacturer's reputation is on the line, just like a radiologist's, and Medicare even reimburses CAD interpretations. While their current track record is not that good for breast masses compared to expert radiologists, with proper understanding of what is limiting CAD, namely the search process, there is no doubt in my opinion, that future generations CAD algorithms will approach and even surpass expert radiologists.

\hypertarget{visual-search-discussion-summary}{%
\section{TBA Discussion / Summary}\label{visual-search-discussion-summary}}

This chapter has introduced the terminology associated with a search task: recognition/finding, classification, and detection. Search involves finding lesions and correctly classifying them, so two types of expertise are relevant: search expertise is the ability to find (true) lesions without finding non-lesions, while classification accuracy is concerned with correct classification (benign vs.~malignant) of a suspicious region that has already been found. Quantification of these abilities is described in the next chapter. Two paradigms are used to measure search, one in the non-medical context and the other, the focus of this book, in the medical context. The second method is based on the eye tracking measurements performed while radiologists perform quasi-clinical tasks (performing eye-tracking measurements in a true clinical setting is difficult). A method for analyzing eye-tracking data using methods developed for FROC analysis has been described. It has the advantage of taking into account information present in eye-tracking data, such as dwell time and approach rate, in a quantitative manner, essentially by treating them as eye-tracking ratings to which modern FROC methods can be applied. The Kundel-Nodine model of visual search in diagnostic imaging was described. The next chapter describes a statistical parameterization of this model, termed the radiological search model (RSM).

\section{Introduction}\label{rsm-intro}}

All models of ROC data \emph{not incorporating search} involve two fundamental parameters (i.e, not including binning-related threshold parameters). For example, the unequal variance binormal model in Chapter TBA (binormal-model) requires the \(a,b\) parameters. Alternative ROC models described in TBA Chapter 20 also require two fundamental parameters.

\emph{It turns out that all that is needed to model as seemingly complex a process as visual search, at least to first order, is one additional fundamental parameter}. The RSM contains three fundamental parameters: \(\mu\), \(\lambda\) and \(\nu\). However, it is easier to introduce the RSM via \(\mu\) and intermediate primed parameters, \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\). The model is then re-parameterized to take into account that \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\) must depend on \(\mu\) via un-primed parameters \(\lambda\) and \(\nu\) \emph{which are intrinsic parameters}, i.e., independent of \(\mu\).

The RSM is a model of the FROC paradigm. It accounts for all features characterizing the FROC paradigm, including localization and the random non-negative numbers of NLs and LLs per image.

\hypertarget{rsm-details}{%
\section{The radiological search model}\label{rsm-details}}

The radiological search model (RSM) for the free-response paradigm is a statistical parameterization of the Nodine-Kundel model. It consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A \emph{search stage} corresponding to the initial glance in the Nodine-Kundel model, in which suspicious regions, i.e., the latent marks, are flagged for subsequent foveal scanning. The total number of latent marks on a case is \(\geq 0\); some cases may have zero latent marks, a fact that will turn out to have important consequences for the shapes of all RSM predicted operating characteristics.
\item
  A \emph{decision stage} during which each latent mark is closely examined (via foveal scanning), relevant features are extracted and analyzed and the observer calculates a decision variable or z-sample for each latent mark. The number of z-samples equals the number of latent marks.
\item
  If the z-sample exceeds a pre-selected minimum reporting threshold the location is marked, i.e., the latent mark is recorded as an actual mark.
\item
  Latent marks can be either latent NLs (corresponding to non-diseased regions) or latent LLs (corresponding to diseased regions). The number of latent NLs on a case is denoted \(l_1\). The number of latent LLs on a diseased case is denoted \(l_2\). Latent NLs can occur on non-diseased and diseased cases, but latent LLs can only occur on diseased cases. We will initially assume that every diseased case has \(L\) actual lesions. Later this will be extended to arbitrary number of lesions per diseased case. Since the number of latent LLs cannot exceed the number of lesions, \(0 \leq l_2 \leq L\) . The symbol \(l_s\) denotes a location with site-level truth state \(s\), where \(s = 1\) for a NL and \(s = 2\) for a LL. \footnote{In this chapter distributional assumptions are made for the numbers of latent NLs and LLs and the associated z-samples. Since the RSM is a parametric model one does not need the four subscript notation needed to account for case and location dependence, as necessary in the empirical description in Chapter \ref{empirical}. This allows for a simpler notation, as the reader may have noticed, unencumbered by the 4 subscripts in Table \ref{empirical-notation}.}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{rsm-assumptions}{%
\section{RSM assumptions}\label{rsm-assumptions}}

\textbf{Assumption 1:} The number of latent NLs, \(l_1 \geq 0\), is sampled from the Poisson distribution \(\text{Poi}\) with mean \(\lambda'\):

\begin{equation} 
l_1 \sim \text{Poi}\left ( \lambda' \right ) 
\label{eq:rsm-poisson-sampling}
\end{equation}

The probability mass function (pmf) of the Poisson distribution is defined by:

\begin{equation} 
\text{pmf}_{Poi}\left ( l_1, \lambda' \right ) = exp\left ( -\lambda' \right ) \frac{{(\lambda')^{l_1}}}{(l_1')!}
\label{eq:rsm-poisson-pmf}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Assumption 2:} The number of latent LLs, \(l_2\), where \(0 \leq l_2 \leq L\), is sampled from the binomial distribution \(\text{Bin}\) with success probability \(\nu'\) and trial size \(L\):

\begin{equation} 
l_2 \sim \text{Bin}\left ( L, \nu' \right ) 
\label{eq:rsm-binomial-sampling}
\end{equation}

The pmf of the binomial distribution is defined by:

\begin{equation} 
\text{pmf}_{Bin}\left ( l_2, L, \nu' \right ) = \binom{L}{l_2} \left (\nu'  \right )^{l_2} \left (1-\nu'  \right )^{L-l_2}
\label{eq:rsm-binomial-pmf}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Assumption 3:} Each latent mark is associated with a z-sample. That for a latent NL is denoted \(z_{l_1}\) while that for a latent LL is denoted \(z_{l_2}\). Latent NLs can occur on non-diseased and diseased cases while latent LLs can only occur on diseased cases.

\textbf{Assumption 4:} For latent NLs the z-samples are obtained by sampling \(N \left ( 0, 1 \right )\):

\begin{equation} 
z_{l_1} \sim N \left ( 0, 1 \right )
\label{eq:rsm-sampling-l1}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Assumption 5:} For latent LLs the z-samples are obtained by sampling \(N \left ( \mu, 1 \right )\):

\begin{equation} 
z_{l_2} \sim N \left ( \mu, 1 \right )
\label{eq:rsm-sampling-l2}
\end{equation}

The probability density function \(\phi\left ( z | \mu \right )\) of the normal distribution \(N \left ( \mu, 1 \right )\) is defined by:

\begin{equation} 
\phi\left ( z | \mu \right )=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left ( -\frac{(z-\mu)^2}{2} \right )
\label{eq:rsm-pdf-phi-mu}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Binning rule:} In an FROC study with R ratings, the observer adopts \(R\) ordered cutoffs \(\zeta_r\), where \(\left ( r = 1, 2, ..., R \right )\). Defining \(\zeta_0 = -\infty\) and \(\zeta_{R+1} = \infty\), then if \(\zeta_r \leq z_{l_s} < \zeta_{r+1}\) the corresponding latent site is marked and rated in bin \(r\), and if \(z_{l_s} \leq \zeta_1\) the site is not marked.

\textbf{Mark location:} The location of the mark is assumed to be at the exact center of the latent site that exceeded a cutoff and an infinitely precise proximity criterion is adopted. Consequently, there is no confusing a mark made because of a latent LL z-sample exceeding the cutoff with one made because of a latent NL z-sample exceeding the cutoff. Therefore, any mark made because of a latent NL z-sample that satisfies \(\zeta_r \leq z_{l_1} < \zeta_{r+1}\) will be scored as a non-lesion localization (NL) and rated \(r\). Likewise, any mark made because of a latent LL z-sample that satisfies \(\zeta_r \leq z_{l_2} < \zeta_{r+1}\) will be scored as a lesion-localization (LL) and rated \(r\).

\textbf{Rating assigned to unmarked sites:} Unmarked LLs are assigned the zero rating: even lesions that were not flagged by the search stage, and therefore do not qualify as latent LLs, are assigned the zero rating. This is because they represent observable events. In contrast, unmarked latent NLs are unobservable events (unlike lesions, there is no a-priori reader-independent list of non-lesion locations; in fact, what constitutes a NL is reader dependent).

By choosing \(R\) large enough, the preceding discrete rating model is applicable to continuous z-samples.

\hypertarget{rsm-parameter-interpretations}{%
\section{Physical interpretation of RSM parameters}\label{rsm-parameter-interpretations}}

The parameters \(\mu\), \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\) have the following meanings:

\hypertarget{rsm-mu-parameter}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The \(\mu\) parameter}{The \textbackslash mu parameter}}\label{rsm-mu-parameter}}

The \(\mu\) parameter is the lesion contrast-to-noise-ratio, or more accurately, the perceptual signal to noise ratio \emph{pSNR} introduced in (book) Chapter 12, between latent NLs and latent LLs. It is not the pSNR of the latent LL relative to its immediate surround. For structured backgrounds - as opposed to homogeneous backgrounds - pSNR is determined by the competition for the observer's foveal attention from other regions, outside the immediate surround, that could be mistaken for lesions.

The \(\mu\) parameter is similar to detectability index \(d'\), which is the separation parameter of two unit normal distributions required to achieve the observed probability of correct choice (PC) in a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) task between cued (i.e., pointed to by toggle-able arrows) NLs and cued LLs. Individually and for each reader one determines the locations of the latent marks using eye-tracking apparatus and then runs a 2AFC study as follows: pairs of images are shown, each with a cued location, one a latent NL and the other a latent LL, where all locations were recorded in prior eye-tracking sessions for the specific radiologist. The radiologist's task is to pick the image with the latent LL. The probability correct \(\text{PC}\) in this task is related to the \(d'\) parameter by:

\begin{equation} 
\mu = \sqrt{2} \Phi^{-1} \left ( \text{PC} \right )
\label{eq:rsm-mu-2afc}
\end{equation}

The radiologist on whom the eye-tracking measurements are performed and the one who performs the two alternative forced choice tasks must be the same, as two radiologists may not agree on latent NL marks. A complication in conducting such a study is that because of memory effects a lesion can only be shown once to each reader: clinical images are distinctive - once a radiologist has found a lesion in a clinical image, that event becomes imprinted in long-term memory; one cannot repeatedly compare this lesion to other NLs in the 2AFC task as the radiologist will always pick the remembered lesion.

\hypertarget{rsm-summary-lambda-prime-parameter}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The \(\lambda'\) parameter}{The \textbackslash lambda' parameter}}\label{rsm-summary-lambda-prime-parameter}}

The \(\lambda'\) parameter determines the tendency of the observer to generate latent NLs. The mean number of latent NLs per case is an estimate of \(\lambda'\). \footnote{It can be measured via eye-tracking apparatus. This time it is only necessary to cluster the marks and classify each mark as a latent NL or latent LL according to the adopted acceptance radius. An eye-tracking based estimate would be the total number of latent NLs in the dataset divided by the total number of cases.}

Consider two observers, one with \(\lambda' = 1\) and the other with \(\lambda' = 2\). While one cannot predict the exact number of latent NLs on any specific case, one can predict the average number of latent NLs on a given case set.

In the following examples the number of samples has been set to \(K_1=100\) (the first argument to \texttt{rpois()}; the second argument is \(\lambda'\)).

For reader 1 the estimate of the Poisson parameter (the mean parameter of the Poisson distribution is frequently referred to as the Poisson parameter) is 1.01 with 95\% confidence interval (0.823, 1.227); for reader 2 the corresponding estimates are 2.02 and (1.751, 2.319). As the number of cases increases, the confidence interval shrinks. For example, with 10000 cases, i.e., 100 times the value in the previous example:

This time for reader 1, the estimate of the Poisson parameter is 1.01 with 95\% confidence interval (0.986, 1.025); for reader 2 the corresponding estimate is 2.01 with 95\% confidence interval (1.978, 2.034).

\hypertarget{rsm-summary-nu-parameter}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The \(\nu'\) parameter}{The \textbackslash nu' parameter}}\label{rsm-summary-nu-parameter}}

The \(\nu'\) parameter determines the ability of the observer to find lesions. Assuming the same number of lesions per diseased case, the mean fraction of latent LLs per diseased case is an estimate of \(\nu'\). \footnote{It too can be measured via eye-tracking apparatus performed on a radiologist. An eye-tracking based estimate would be the total number of latent LLs in the dataset divided by the total number of lesions.} Consider two observers, one with \(\nu' = 0.5\) and the other with \(\nu' = 0.9\). Again, while one cannot predict the precise number of latent LLs on any specific diseased case, or which specific lesions will be correctly localized, one can predict the average number of latent LLs per diseased case.

The following code also uses \(K_2 = 100\) samples, the number of diseased cases, each with one lesion.

For reader 2 the corresponding estimates are 0.94 and (0.87, 0.98). As the number of diseased cases increases, the confidence interval shrinks in inverse proportion to the square root of cases.

\hypertarget{rsm-re-parameterization}{%
\section{Model re-parameterization}\label{rsm-re-parameterization}}

While the parameters \(\mu\), \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\) are physically meaningful a little thought reveals that they cannot be varied independently of each other. Rather, \(\mu\) is the \emph{intrinsic} parameter whose value, together with two other intrinsic parameters \(\lambda\) and \(\nu\), determine \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\), respectively. The following is a convenient re-parameterization \footnote{The need for the first re-parameterization, involving \(\nu'\), was foreseen in the original search model papers \citep{chakraborty2006search, chakraborty2006roc} but the need for the second re-parameterization (involving \(\lambda'\)) was discovered more recently.}:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\nu' =& 1 - exp\left ( - \mu \nu \right ) \\
\lambda' =& \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-transform}
\end{equation}

The inverse transformations are:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\nu =& - \frac{\ln \left ( 1-\nu' \right )}{\mu}\\
\lambda =& \mu \lambda' 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-inv-transform}
\end{equation}

The parameter limits are as follows: \(0 \le \nu' \le 1\), \(\lambda' \ge 0\), \(\mu \ge 0\), \(\lambda \ge 0\) and \(\nu \ge 0\).

Since it determines \(\nu'\), the \(\nu\) parameter can be considered as the intrinsic (i.e., \(\mu\)-independent) ability to find lesions; specifically, it is the rate of increase of \(\nu'\) with \(\mu\) at small \(\mu\):

\begin{equation} 
\nu = \left (\frac{\partial \nu'}{\partial \mu}  \right )_{\mu = 0}
\label{eq:rsm-nup-limit}
\end{equation}

The colloquial term \emph{find} is used as shorthand for \emph{flagged for further inspection by the holistic 1st stage of the search mechanism, thus qualifying as a latent site}. In other words, \emph{finding} a lesion means the lesion was perceived as a suspicious region, which makes it a latent site, independent of whether or not the region was actually marked. Finding refers to the search stage. Marking refers to the decision stage, where the region's z-sample is determined and compared to a marking threshold.

According to Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-transform}, as \(\mu \rightarrow \infty\), \(\nu' \rightarrow 1\) and conversely, as \(\mu \rightarrow 0\), \(\nu' \rightarrow 0\). The dependence of \(\nu'\) on \(\mu\) is consistent with the fact that higher contrast lesions are easier to find. An observer without special expertise may find a high contrast lesion. Conversely, lower contrast lesions will be more difficult to find even by expert observers.

The analogy to finding the sun \ref{froc-paradigm-solar-analogy} is instructive: objects with very high perceptual SNR are certain to be found.

According to Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-transform} the value of \(\mu\) also determines \(\lambda'\): as \(\mu \rightarrow \infty\), \(\lambda' \rightarrow 0\), and conversely, as \(\mu \rightarrow 0\), \(\lambda' \rightarrow \infty\). Here too the sun analogy is instructive. Since the sun has very high contrast, there is no reason for the observer to searcch for other suspicious regions which have no possibility of resembling the sun. On the other hand, attempting to locate a faint star, possibly hidden by clouds, can generate latent NLs, because the expected small SNR from the faint real star could be comparable to that from a number of regions in the near background.

The re-parameterization used here is not unique, but is simple and has the right limiting behaviors.

\hypertarget{rsm-discussion-summary}{%
\section{Discussion / Summary}\label{rsm-discussion-summary}}

This chapter has described a statistical parameterization of the Nodine-Kundel model. The 3-parameter model of search in the context in the medical imaging accommodates key aspects of the process: search, the ability to find lesions while minimizing finding non-lesions, is described by two parameters, specifically, \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\) . The ability to correctly mark a found lesion (while not marking found non-lesions) is characterized by the third parameter of the model, \(\mu\). While the primed parameters have relatively simple physical meaning, they depend on \(\mu\). Consequently, it is necessary to define them in terms of intrinsic parameters.

The next chapter explores the predictions of the radiological search model.

\section{TBA Introduction}\label{rsm-pred-intro}}

The preceding chapter described the radiological search model (RSM) for FROC data. This chapter describes predictions of the RSM.
The starting point is a general characteristic of all RSM prediced operating characteristics, namely they have the constrained end-point property. Derived next is the predicted \emph{inferred ROC} curve followed by the predicted FROC and AFROC curves.

Shown next is how \emph{search performance} and \emph{lesion-classification} performance can be measured from the inferred ROC curve. Search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions, and lesion-classification performance is the ability, having found a suspicious region, to correctly classify it. Lesion-classification is different from (case) classification performance, i.e., distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased cases, which is measured by the area AUC under the ROC curve.

TBA Based on the ROC/FROC/AFROC curve predictions of the RSM, a comparison is presented between area measures that can be calculated from FROC data, leading to an important and perhaps surprising conclusion, \emph{the FROC curve is a poor descriptor of search performance and that the AFROC/wAFROC curves are preferred}. Most applications of FROC methods, particularly in CAD, have relied on the FROC curve to measure performance.

In this chapter formulae for RSM quantities are given in terms of the physical search parameters \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\). The formulae can be transformed to intrinsic RSM parameters \(\lambda\) and \(\nu\) using Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-inv-transform}.

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-inferred-roc}{%
\section{Inferred ROC ratings}\label{rsm-pred-inferred-roc}}

Consider a \(R_{\text{FROC}} \geq 1\) rating FROC study with allowed ratings \(r = 1, 2, ..., R_{\text{FROC}}\). To be clearer one precedes the rating with the applicable paradigm: e.g., the ratings of marks range from FROC:1 to FROC:\(R_{\text{FROC}}\). \textbf{The inferred-ROC z-sample (continuous rating) of a case is defined as the z-sample of the highest rated mark on the case or \(-\infty\) if the case has no marks.} The inferred-ROC rating ROC:1 is reserved for cases with no marks. Since the ratings are ordered labels no ordering information is lost provided every other ROC rating is also ``bumped up'' by unity. The ROC ratings scale therefore extends from \(1\) to \(R_{\text{FROC}} + 1\). Thus, a \(R_{\text{FROC}}\) rating FROC study corresponds to a \(R_{\text{FROC}} + 1\) rating ROC study. The symbol \(h_{k_t t}\) is used to denote the rating of the highest rated z-sample on case \(k_t t\) with truth state \(t\). Thus \(h_{k_1 1}\) refers to the highest rating on a non-diseased case \(k_1 1\) and \(h_{k_2 2}\) refers to the highest rating on diseased case \(k_2 2\). For non-diseased cases, the maximum is over all latent NLs on the case. For diseased cases, the maximum is over all latent NLs \emph{and} latent LLs on the case. Define the set of ordered thresholds \(\zeta_r < \zeta_{r+1}\) and dummy thresholds \(\zeta_0 = -\infty, \zeta_{R_{\text{FROC}}+1} = \infty\). Then, if \(\zeta_r \leq h_{k_t t} < \zeta_{r+1}\), where \(r = 1, 2, ..., R_{\text{FROC}}\), the case is rated ROC:\((r+1)\) and if \(h_{k_t t} < \zeta_{1}\) the case is rated ROC:1. The lowest possible ROC rating on a case with at least one mark is ROC:2. A case with no latent sites \emph{or} if the highest rated latent site satisfies \(h_{k_t t} < \zeta_{1}\) is rated ROC:1. Note that one cannot distinguish between whether the ROC:1 rating was the result of the case not having any latent sites or the case had at least one latent site, but none of the z-samples exceeded \(\zeta_{1}\).

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-end-point}{%
\section{End-point of the ROC}\label{rsm-pred-end-point}}

A consequence of the possibility that some cases have no marks is that the ROC curve has the \emph{constrained end-point property}, namely the full range of ROC space, i.e., \(0 \leq \text{FPF} \leq 1\) and \(0 \leq \text{TPF} \leq 1\), is not continuously accessible to the observer. In fact, \(0 \leq \text{FPF} \leq \text{FPF}_{max}\) and \(0 \leq \text{TPF} \leq \text{TPF}_{max}\) where \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) and \(\text{TPF}_{max}\) are generally less than unity.

Starting from a finite value as \(\zeta_1\) is lowered to \(-\infty\) some of the previously ROC:1 rated cases that had at least one latent site but whose z-sample did not exceed \(\zeta_1\) will now generate marks and therefore the case will be ``bumped-up'' to the ROC:2 bin, until eventually \emph{only cases with no latent sites} remain in the ROC:1 bin - these cases will never be rated ROC:2. An observer who finds no suspicious regions, literally nothing to report, will assign the lowest available bin to the case, which happens to be ROC:1. The finite number of cases in the ROC:1 bin at infinitely low threshold has the consequence that the uppermost non-trivial continuously accessible operating point -- that obtained by cumulating ratings ROC:2 and above - is below-left of (1,1). The (1,1) point is ``trivially'' reached when one cumulates the counts in all bins, i.e., ROC:1 and above. This behavior is distinct from traditional ROC models where the entire curve, extending from (0, 0) to (1, 1), is continuously accessible to the observer. This is because in conventional ROC models every case yields a finite decision variable, no matter how small. Lowering the lowest threshold to \(-\infty\) eventually moves all cases in the previously ROC:1 bin to the ROC:2 bin, and one is eventually left with zero counts in the ROC:1 bin and the operating point, obtained by cumulating bins ROC:2 and above, is (1,1).

As another way of describing this unusual behavior, as the observer is encouraged to be more ``aggressive in reporting lesions'', the ROC point moves continuously upwards and to the right from (0, 0) to the end-point, \(\left (\text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\), and no further. The ROC curve cannot just ``hang there'' since cumulating all cases always yields the (1,1) operating point. \textbf{Therefore, the complete ROC curve is obtained by extending the end-point using a dashed line that connects it to (1,1).} The observer cannot operate along the dashed line. In the language of ``moving up the ROC curve'' there is a discontinuous jump from the end-point to (1,1). At the end-point the shape of the ROC curve changes from concave-down to a dashed straight line. It can be shown TBA that the limiting slope of the continuous ROC at the end-point is equal to the slope of the dashed straight line connecting the end-point to (1,1).

How closely the operating point approaches the limiting point \(\left (\text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\) is unrelated to the number of bins; rather, it depends on \(\zeta_1\). As the latter is lowered the observed end-point approaches \(\left (\text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\) from below-left. As will be shown below, how closely \(\left (\text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\) approaches (1,1) depends on the \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\) RSM parameters: namely, as \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\) increase, \(\left (\text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\) approaches (1,1) from below-left.

\subsection{The abscissa of the ROC end-point}\label{rsm-pred-constrained-end-point-abscissa}}

Consider the probability that a non-diseased case has at least one latent NL. Such a case will generate a finite value of \(h_{k_1 1}\) and with an appropriately low \(\zeta_1\) it will be rated ROC:2 or higher. The probability of \emph{zero} latent NLs, see Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-poisson-pmf}, is:

\[\text{pmf}_{Poi} \left (0,\lambda' \right ) = \text{exp} \left ( -\lambda' \right )\].

Therefore the probability that the case has \emph{at least one} latent NL is the complement of the above probability. At sufficiently low \(\zeta_1\) each of these cases yields a FP. Therefore, the maximum continuously accessible abscissa of the ROC, i.e., \(\text{FPF}_{max}\), is:

\begin{equation} 
\text{FPF}_{max} = 1 - \text{exp} \left ( -\lambda' \right )
\label{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-max}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-constrained-end-point-ordinate}{%
\subsection{The ordinate of the ROC end-point}\label{rsm-pred-constrained-end-point-ordinate}}

A diseased case has no marks, even for very low \(\zeta_1\), if it has zero latent NLs, the probability of which is \(\text{exp}(-\lambda')\), and it has zero latent LLs, the probability of which is, see Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-binomial-pmf}, \(\text{pmf}_{Bin} \left ( 0, L, \nu' \right )= (1 - \nu')^L\).

Here \(L\) is the number of lesions in each diseased case, assumed constant.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Assumption 1: occurrences of latent LLs are independent of each other, i.e., the probability that a lesion is found is independent of whether other lesions are found on the same case.
\item
  Assumption 2: occurrences of latent NLs are independent of each other; i.e., the probability of a NL is independent of whether other NLs are found on the same case.
\item
  Assumption 3: occurrence of a latent NL is independent of the occurrence of a latent LL on the same case.
\end{itemize}

By these assumptions the probability of zero latent NLs \emph{and} zero latent LLs on a diseased case is the product of the two probabilities, namely

\[\text{exp}(-\lambda') (1 - \nu')^L\].

Therefore, the probability that there exists \emph{at least one} latent site is the complement of the above expression, which equals \(\text{TPF}_{max}\), i.e.,

\begin{equation}
\text{TPF}_{max} \left ( \mu, \lambda', \nu', L \right ) = 1 - \text{exp} \left ( - \lambda' \right ) \left ( 1 - \nu' \right )^L
\label{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-max}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-end-point-variable-number-lesions}{%
\subsection{Variable number of lesions per case}\label{rsm-pred-end-point-variable-number-lesions}}

Defining \(f_L\) the fraction of diseased cases with \(L\) lesions and \(L_{max}\) the maximum number of lesions per diseased case in the dataset, then:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{L=1}^{{L_{max}}}  f_L = 1
\label{eq:rsm-pred-fl-sum}
\end{equation}

By restricting attention to the set of diseased cases with \(L\) lesions each, Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-max} for \(\text{TPF}_{max}\) applies. Since TPF is a probability and probabilities of independent processes add it follows that:

\begin{equation}
\text{TPF}_{max} \left ( \mu, \lambda', \nu', L \right ) = 1 - \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}}f_L\text{exp} \left ( - \lambda' \right ) \left ( 1 - \nu' \right )^L
\label{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-max-fl1}
\end{equation}

The ordinate of the end-point is a weighted summation of \(\text{TPF}_{max} \left ( \mu, \lambda', \nu', L \right )\) over the lesion distribution vector \(\overrightarrow{f_L}\).

The expression for \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) is unaffected.

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-roc-curve}{%
\section{ROC curve}\label{rsm-pred-roc-curve}}

On the continuous ROC curve each case has at least one mark and therefore the inferred ROC decision variable is the rating of the highest rated mark \(h_{k_t t}\) on the case. Therefore, FPF is the probability that \(h_{k_t t}\) on a non-diseased case exceeds \(\zeta\) and TPF is the probability that \(h_{k_t t}\) on a diseased case exceeds \(\zeta\):

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\text{FPF}\left (\zeta  \right ) =& P\left ( h_{k_1 1} \geq \zeta \right )\\
\text{TPF}\left (\zeta  \right ) =& P\left ( h_{k_2 2} \geq \zeta \right )
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-fpf-zeta}
\end{equation}

Varying the threshold parameter \(\zeta\) from \(\infty\) to \(-\infty\) sweeps out the continuous section of the predicted ROC curve from (0,0) to \(\left (\text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assumption 4: the z-samples of NLs on the same case are independent of each other.
\end{itemize}

Consider the set of non-diseased cases with \(n\) latent NLs each, where \(n > 0\). According to \ref{rsm-assumptions} each latent NL yields a z sample from \(N(0,1)\). The probability that a z-sample from a latent NL is smaller than \(\zeta\) is \(\Phi(\zeta)\). By the independence assumption the probability that all \(n\) samples are smaller than \(\zeta\) is \((\Phi(\zeta))^n\). If all z-samples are smaller than \(\zeta\), then the highest z-sample \(h_{k_1 1}\) must be smaller than \(\zeta\). Therefore, the probability that \(h_{k_1 1}\) exceeds \(\zeta\) is:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\text{FPF}\left (\zeta \mid n \right ) =& P\left ( h_{k_1 1} \geq  \zeta \mid n\right ) \\
=& 1 - \left [ \Phi\left ( \zeta \right )  \right ]^n
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-zeta-n}
\end{equation}

The conditioning notation in Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-zeta-n} reflects the fact that this expression applies specifically to non-diseased cases with \(n\) latent NLs each. To obtain \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) one performs a Poisson-weighted summation of \(\text{FPF}\left (\zeta \mid n \right )\) over \(n\) from 0 to \(\infty\) (the inclusion of the \(n = 0\) term is explained below):

\begin{equation}
\text{FPF}\left (\zeta, \lambda' \right ) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \text{pmf}_{Poi} \left ( n, \lambda' \right )\text{FPF}\left (\zeta \mid n \right )
\label{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-zeta-before-maple}
\end{equation}

The infinite summations, see below, are easier performed using symbolic algebra software such as \(\text{Maple}^{TM}\). Inclusion in the summation of \(n = 0\), which term evaluates to zero, is done to make it easier for Maple to evaluate the summation in closed form. Otherwise one may need to simplify the Maple-generated result. The \texttt{Maple} code is shown below (Maple 17, Waterloo Maple Inc.), where \texttt{lambda} and \texttt{nu} refer to the primed quantities.

\begin{verbatim}
# Maple Code
restart;
phi := proc (t, mu) exp(-(1/2)*(t-mu)^2)/sqrt(2*Pi) end: 
PHI := proc (c, mu) local t; int(phi(t, mu), t = -infinity .. c) end: 
Poisson := proc (n, lambda) lambda^n*exp(-lambda)/factorial(n) end: 
Bin := proc (l, L, nu) binomial(L, l)*nu^l*(1-nu)^(L-l) end:
FPF := proc(zeta,lambda) sum(Poisson(n,lambda)*(1 - PHI(zeta,0)^n), n=0..infinity);end:
FPF(zeta, lambda);   
\end{verbatim}

The above code yields:

\begin{equation}
\text{FPF}\left (\zeta , \lambda'\right ) = 1 - \text{exp}\left ( -\frac{\lambda'}{2} \left [ 1-\text{erf}\left ( \frac{\zeta}{\sqrt{2}} \right ) \right ]  \right ) 
\label{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-erf}
\end{equation}

The error function in Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-erf} is related to the unit normal CDF function \(\Phi(x)\) by:

\begin{equation}
\text{erf} \left (x \right ) =  2\Phi \left ( \sqrt{2} x\right ) - 1
\label{eq:rsm-pred-erf-phi-relation}
\end{equation}

Using this transformation yields the following simpler expression for FPF:

\begin{equation}
\text{FPF}\left (\zeta , \lambda'\right ) = 1 - \text{exp}\left ( -\lambda' \Phi\left ( -\zeta \right )  \right )
\label{eq:rsm-pred-fpf}
\end{equation}

The software implementation follows:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Shaded}

Because \(\Phi\) ranges from 0 to 1, \(\text{FPF}\left (\zeta , \lambda'\right )\) ranges from 0 to \(\text{exp} \left ( -\lambda' \right )\).

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-roc-curve-tpf}{%
\subsection{Derivation of TPF}\label{rsm-pred-roc-curve-tpf}}

The derivation of the true positive fraction \(\text{TPF}(\zeta)\) follows a similar line of reasoning except this time one needs to consider the highest of the latent NLs and latent LL z-samples. Consider a diseased case with L lesions, \(n\) latent NLs and \(l\) latent LLs. Each latent NL yields a decision variable sample from \(N(0,1)\) and each latent LL yields a sample from \(N(\mu,1)\). The probability that all \(n\) latent NLs have z-samples less than \(\zeta\) is \([\Phi(\zeta)]^n\). The probability that all \(l\) latent LLs have z-samples less than \(\zeta\) is \([\Phi(\zeta - \mu)]^l\). Using the independence assumptions, the probability that all latent marks have z-samples less than \(\zeta\) is the product of these two probabilities. The probability that \(h_{k_2 2}\) (the highest z-sample on diseased case \(k_2 2\)) is larger than \(\zeta\) is the complement of the product probabilities, i.e.,

\[\text{TPF}_{n,l}\left ( \zeta, \mu, n, l, L \right ) = P\left ( h_{k_2 2} \geq \zeta \mid \mu, n, l, L \right ) = 1 - \left [ \Phi\left ( \zeta \right ) \right ]^n \left [ \Phi\left ( \zeta - \mu\right ) \right ]^l\]

One averages over the distributions of \(n\) and \(l\) to obtain the desired ROC-ordinate:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
& \text{TPF}\left ( \zeta, \mu, \lambda', \nu' \right ) \times \\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \text{pmf}_{Poi}(n,\lambda') \times \\
& \sum_{l=0}^{L} \text{pmf}_{Bin}(l,\nu',L) \text{TPF}_{n,l}\left ( \zeta, \mu, n, l \right )
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-varyl}
\end{equation}

This can be evaluated using Maple yielding:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
& \text{TPF}\left (\zeta , \mu, \lambda', \nu', L \right ) \\
&= 1 - \text{exp}\left ( - \lambda' \Phi \left ( - \zeta \right )\right )
\left ( 1 - \nu' \Phi \left ( \mu - \zeta \right ) \right )^L
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-l}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-tpf-varying-lesions}{%
\subsection{Variable number of lesions per case}\label{rsm-pred-tpf-varying-lesions}}

To extend the results to varying numbers of lesions per diseased case, one averages the right hand side of \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-l} over the fraction of diseased cases with \(L\) lesions:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
& \text{TPF}\left (\zeta , \mu, \lambda', \nu', \overrightarrow{f_L} \right ) =  \\
& 1 - \text{exp}\left ( -\lambda' \Phi \left ( -\zeta \right )\right ) 
\sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L  \left ( 1 - \nu' \Phi \left ( \mu -\zeta \right ) \right )^L 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-tpf}
\end{equation}

Since \(\Phi \left ( -\zeta \right )\) tends to unity as \(\zeta_1 \rightarrow -\infty\), this expression reduces to Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-max-fl1} for the ROC end-point.

The expression for FPF, Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf}, is unaffected.

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-roc-curve-proper}{%
\section{Proper ROC curve}\label{rsm-pred-roc-curve-proper}}

A proper ROC curve has the property that it never crosses the chance diagonal and its slope never increases as the operating point moves up the ROC curve \citep{metz1999proper, macmillan2004detection}. \emph{It is shown next that the RSM predicted ROC curve, including the dashed straight line extension, is proper} \footnote{The statement in the physical book that the proper property only applies to the continuous section is incorrect.}. We considered first the continuous section which is below-left of the end-point. In \ref{rsm-pred-appendix1} a proof is presented that the slope is continuous at the end-point transition from a continuous curve to the dashed straight line. In \ref{rsm-pred-appendix2} the slope near the end-point is examined numerically to resolve an apparent paradox, namely the ROC plot can appear discontinuous at the end-point when in fact no discontinuity exists.

For convenience one abbreviates FPF and TPF to \(x\) and \(y\), respectively, and suppresses the dependence on model parameters. From Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf} and Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf} one can express the ROC coordinates as:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
x\left ( \zeta \right ) =& 1 - G\left ( \zeta \right )\\
y\left ( \zeta \right ) =& 1 - F\left ( \zeta \right ) G\left ( \zeta \right ) 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-f-g}
\end{equation}

where:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
G\left ( \zeta \right ) =& \text{exp}\left ( -\lambda' \Phi \left ( -\zeta \right )\right )\\
F\left ( \zeta \right ) =& \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L  \left ( 1 - \nu' \Phi \left ( \mu -\zeta \right ) \right )^L 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-fg-defs}
\end{equation}

These equations have exactly the same structure as \citep{swensson1996unified} Eqns. 1 and 2 and the logic used there to demonstrate that ROC curves predicted by Swensson's LROC model was proper also applies to the present situation. Specifically, since the \(\Phi\) function ranges between 0 and 1 and \(0 \leq \nu' \leq 1\), it follows that \(F\left ( \zeta \right ) \leq 1\). Therefore \(y\left ( \zeta \right ) \geq x\left ( \zeta \right )\) and the ROC curve is constrained to the upper half of the ROC space, namely the portion above the chance diagonal. Additionally, the more general constraint shown by Swensson applies, namely the slope of the ROC curve at any operating point (x, y) cannot be less than the slope of the dashed straight line connecting (x, y) and \(\left (\text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\), the coordinates of the RSM end-point. This implies that the slope decreases monotonically and also rules out curves with ``hooks''.

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-roc-curve-pdfs}{%
\section{ROC decision variable pdfs}\label{rsm-pred-roc-curve-pdfs}}

In TBA (binormal-model-pdf-curves-appendix-1) the pdf functions were derived for non-diseased and diseased cases for the unequal variance binormal ROC model. The procedure was to take the derivative of the appropriate cumulative distribution function (CDF) with respect to \(\zeta\). An identical procedure is used for the RSM.

The CDF for non-diseased cases is the complement of FPF. The pdf for non-diseased cases is given by:

\begin{equation}
\text{pdf}_N\left ( \zeta \right ) = \frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta} \left ( 1-\text{FPF}\left (\zeta , \lambda'\right ) \right ) 
\label{eq:rsm-pred-pdf-n}
\end{equation}

Similarly, for diseased cases,

\begin{equation}
\text{pdf}_D\left ( \zeta \right ) = \frac{\partial }{\partial \zeta} \left ( 1-\text{TPF}\left (\zeta , \mu, \lambda', \nu', \overrightarrow{f_L} \right ) \right ) 
\label{eq:rsm-pred-pdf-d}
\end{equation}

Both expressions can be evaluated using Maple. The pdfs are implemented in the \texttt{RJafroc} function \texttt{PlotRsmOperatingCharacteristics()}.

The integrals of the pdfs (non-diseased followed by diseased) over the entire allowed range are given by (note the vertical bar notation, meaning the difference of two limiting values):

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\text{pdf}_N \left ( \zeta \right )d \zeta =& \left ( 1-\text{FPF}\left (\zeta , \lambda'\right ) \right ) \bigg \rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
=& \text{FPF}_{max}
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-int-pdf-n}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\text{pdf}_D \left ( \zeta \right )d \zeta =& \left ( 1-\text{TPF}\left (\zeta , \mu, \lambda', \nu', \overrightarrow{f_L} \right ) \right ) \bigg \rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
=& \text{TPF}_{max}
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-int-pdf-d}
\end{equation}

In other words, they evaluate to the coordinates of the predicted end-point, \emph{each of which is less than unity}. The reason is that the integration is along the \emph{continuous} section of the ROC curve and does not include the contribution along the dashed straight line extension from \(\left ( \text{FPF}_{max}, \text{TPF}_{max} \right )\) to (1,1). The latter contributions correspond to cases with no marks, i.e., \(1 - \text{FPF}_{max}\) for non-diseased cases and \(1 - \text{TPF}_{max}\) for diseased cases. Adding these contributions to the integrals along the continuous section yields unity for both types of cases. \footnote{The original RSM publications \citep{chakraborty2006search, chakraborty2006roc} unnecessarily introduced Dirac delta functions to force the integrals to be unity. The explanation given here should clarify the issue.}

\hypertarget{rsm-pred-roc-curve-auc}{%
\section{ROC AUC}\label{rsm-pred-roc-curve-auc}}

It is possible to numerically perform the integration under the RSM-ROC curve to get AUC:

\begin{equation}
AUC_{RSM}^{ROC}\left ( \mu, \lambda, \nu,  \zeta_1, \overrightarrow{f_L} \right ) = \sum_{L=0}^{L_{max}} f_L \int_{0}^{1} \text{TPF}\left (\zeta,  \mu, \lambda, \nu, L \right ) d\left ( \text{FPF}\left (\zeta, \lambda \right ) \right )
\label{eq:rsm-pred-auc}
\end{equation}

The superscript \(ROC\) is needed to keep track of the operating characteristic that is being predicted (for RSM other possibilities are AFROC, wAFROC, FROC) and the subscript \(RSM\) keeps track of the predictive model that is being used (for ROC models - binormal, CBM or PROPROC - the superscript is always ROC).

The right hand side of Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-auc} can be evaluated using a numerical integration function implemented in \texttt{R}, which is used in the \texttt{RJafroc} function \texttt{UtilAnalyticalAucsRSM()} whose help page follows:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/rsm-pred/util-analytical-aucs-rsm} 

}

\caption{Help page for `RJafroc` function `UtilAnalyticalAucsRSM`.}\label{fig:rsm-pred-help}
\end{figure}

The arguments to \texttt{UtilAnalyticalAucsRSM()} are the intrinsic RSM parameters \(\mu\), \(\lambda\), \(\nu\) and \(\zeta_1\). The default value of \(\zeta_1\) is \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\). The remaining arguments \texttt{lesDistr} and \texttt{relWeights} are not RSM parameters per se, rather they specify the lesion-richness of the diseased cases and the relative lesion weights (not needed for computing ROC AUC). The dimensions of \texttt{lesDistr} and \texttt{relWeights} are each equal to the maximum number of lesions per case \(L_{max}\). In the following code \(L_{max} = 3\) and \texttt{lesDistr\ \textless{}-\ c(0.5,\ 0.3,\ 0.2)}, meaning 50 percent of diseased cases have one lesion per case, 30 percent have two lesions and 20 percent have three lesions.

The function returns a list containing the AUCs under the ROC and other operating characteristics.

\end{verbatim}

Experimenting with different parameter combinations reveals the following behavior for ROC AUC.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  AUC is an increasing functions of \(\mu\). Increasing perceptual signal-to-noise-ratio leads to improved performance: for background on this important dependence see \ref{froc-paradigm-solar-analogy}. Increasing \(\mu\) increases the separation between the two pdfs defining the ROC curve, which increases AUC. Furthermore, the number of NLs decreases because \(\lambda' = \lambda / \mu\) decreases, which increases performance. Finally, \(\nu'\) increases approaching unity, which leads to more LLs and increased performance. \emph{Because all three effects reinforce each other, a change in \(\mu\) results in a large effect on performance.}
\item
  AUC increases as \(\lambda\) decreases. Decreasing \(\lambda\) results in fewer NLs which results in increased performance. This is a relatively weak effect.
\item
  AUC increases as \(\nu\) increases. Increasing \(\nu\) results in more LLs being marked, which increases performance. This is a relatively strong effect.
\item
  AUC decreases as \(\zeta_1\) increases. This important effect is discussed in the next section.
\item
  ROC AUC increases with \(L_{max}\). With more lesions per case, there is increased probability that that at least one of them will result in a LL, and the diseased case pdf moves to the right, both of which result in increased performance.
\item
  ROC AUC increases as \texttt{lesDistr} is weighted towards more lesions per case. For example, \texttt{lesDistr\ \textless{}-\ c(0,\ 0,\ 1)} (all cases have 3 lesions per case) will yield higher performance than \texttt{lesDistr\ \textless{}-\ c(1,\ 0,\ 0)} (all cases have one lesion per case).

\section{\texorpdfstring{\(\zeta_1\) dependence of ROC AUC}{\textbackslash zeta\_1 dependence of ROC AUC}}\label{rsm-pred-roc-curve-aucs-zeta1}}

When it comes to predicted ROC AUC there is an important difference between conventional ROC models and the RSM. The former has no dependence on \(\zeta_1\). This is because in the ROC model every case yields a rating, no matter how low the z-sample, implying that effectively \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\). The lack of \(\zeta_1\) dependence is demonstrated by the help page for function \texttt{UtilAucBinormal}, shown below, which depends on only two parameters, \(a\) and \(b\) (the two-parameter dependence is also true for other ROC models implemented in \texttt{RJafroc}, e.g., \texttt{UtilAucCBM} and \texttt{UtilAucPROPROC}).

\end{figure}

In contrast, in addition to the basic RSM parameters, i.e., \(\mu\), \(\lambda\) and \(\nu\), the rsm-pred have an additional dependence on \(\zeta_1\). This is because the value of \(\zeta_1\) determines the location of the end-point. The \(\zeta_1\) dependence is demonstrated next for the ROC plots, but it is true for all RSM predictions.

The dependence is demonstrated next for two values: \(zeta_1 = -10\) and \(zeta_1 = 1\). The common parameter values are \(\mu = 2\), \(\lambda = 1\), \(\nu = 1\), as shown in the following code-chunk.

Clearly the red curve has higher AUC. The specific values are 0.9386603 for the red curve and 0.9031788 for the green curve.

\end{figure}

A consequence of the \(\zeta_1\) dependence is that if one uses ROC AUC as the measure of performance, the optimal threshold is \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\). In particular, a CAD algorithm that generates FROC data should show all generated marks to the radiologist. This is not the strategy adopted by any CAD designer that I am aware of. I will address this issue, i.e., what is the optimal value of the reporting threshold, in Chapter \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(optim-op-point)}.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-pred-fig-auc-mu-plots} displays ROC curves for indicated values of \(\mu\). The remaining RSM model parameters are \(\lambda = 1\), \(\nu = 1\) and \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\) and there is one lesion per diseased case.

The following are evident from these figures:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  As \(\mu\) increases the ROC curve more closely approaches the upper-left corner of the ROC plot. This signifies increasing performance and the area under the ROC and AFROC curves approach unity. The end-point abscissa decreases, meaning increasing numbers of unmarked non-diseased cases, i.e., more perfect decisions on non-diseased cases. The end-point ordinate increases, meaning decreasing numbers of unmarked lesions, i.e., more good decisions on diseased cases.
\item
  For \(\mu\) close to zero the operating characteristic approaches the chance diagonal and the area under the ROC curve approaches 0.5.
\item
  The area under the ROC increases monotonically from 0.5 to 1 as \(\mu\) increases from zero to infinity.
\item
  For large \(\mu\) the accessible portion of the operating characteristic approaches the vertical line connecting (0,0) to (0,1), the area under which is zero. The complete ROC curve is obtained by connecting this point to (1,1) by the dashed line and in this limit the area under the complete ROC curve approaches unity. Omitting the area under the dashed portion of the curve will result in a severe underestimate of true performance.
\item
  As \(L_{max}\) increases (allowed values are 1, 2, 3, etc.) the area under the ROC curve increases, approaching unity and \(\text{TPF}_{max}\) approaches unity. With more lesions per diseased case, the chances are higher that at least one of them will be found and marked. However, \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) remains constant as determined by the constant value of \(\lambda' = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\), Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-max}
\item
  As \(\lambda\) decreases \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) decreases to zero and \(\text{TPF}_{max}\) decreases. The decrease in \(\text{TPF}_{max}\) is consistent with the fact that, with fewer NLs, there is less chance of a NL being rated higher than a LL, and one is completely dependent on at least one lesion being found.
\item
  As \(\nu\) increases \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) stays constant at the value determined by \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\), while \(\text{TPF}_{max}\) approaches unity. The corresponding physical parameter \(\nu'\) increases approaching unity, guaranteeing every lesion will be found.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Example RSM pdf curves}\label{rsm-pred-pdf-curves}}

\caption{\label{fig:rsm-pred-fig-pdf-mu-plots}RSM pdf curves for indicated values of the \(\mu\) parameter. The solid curve corresponds to diseased cases and the dotted curve corresponds to non-diseased cases.}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-pred-fig-pdf-mu-plots} shows pdf plots for the same values of parameters as in Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-pred-fig-auc-mu-plots}.

Consider the plot of the pdfs for \(\mu = 1\). Since the integral of a pdf function over an interval amounts to counting the fraction of events occurring in the interval, it should be evident that the area under the non-diseased pdf equals \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) and that under the diseased pdf equals \(\text{TPF}_{max}\). For the chosen value \(\lambda = 1\) one has \(\text{FPF}_{max} = 1 - e^{-\lambda} = 0.632\). The area under the non-diseased pdf is less than unity because it is missing the contribution of non-diseased cases with no marks, the probability of which is \(e^{-\lambda} = e^{-1} = 0.368\). Equivalently, it is missing the area under the dashed straight line segment of the ROC curve. Likewise, the area under the diseased pdf equals \(\text{TPF}_{max}\), Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-max}, which is also less than unity. For the chosen values of \(\mu = \lambda = \nu = L = 1\) it equals \(\text{TPF}_{max} = 1 - e^{-\lambda} e^{-\nu} = 0.865\). This area is somewhat larger than that under the non-diseased pdf, as is evident from visual examination of the plot. A greater fraction of diseased cases generate marks than do non-diseased cases, consistent with the presence of lesions in diseased cases. The complement of 0.865 is due to diseased cases with no marks, which account for a fraction 0.135 of diseased cases. To summarize, the pdf's do not integrate to unity for the reason that the integrals account only for the continuous section of the ROC curve and do not include cases with zero latent marks that do not generate z-samples. The effect becomes more exaggerated for higher values of \(\mu\) as this causes \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) to further decrease.

The plot in Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-pred-fig-pdf-mu-plots} labeled \(\mu = 0.05\) may be surprising. Since it corresponds to a small value of \(\mu\), one may expect both pdfs to overlap and be centered at zero. Instead, while they do overlap, the shape is distinctly non-Gaussian and centered at approximately 1.8. This is because the small value of \(\mu\) results in a large value of the \(\lambda'\) parameter, since \(\lambda' = \lambda / \mu = 20\). The highest of a large number of samples from the unit normal distribution is not normal and is peaked at a value above zero \citep{fisher1928limiting}.

\section{TBA Discussion / Summary}\label{rsm-pred-discussion-summary}}

This chapter has detailed ROC, FROC and AFROC curves predicted by the radiological search model (RSM). All RSM curves share the constrained end-point property that is qualitatively different from previous ROC models. In my experience, it is a property that most researchers in this field have difficulty accepting. There is too much history going back to the early 1940s, of the ROC curve extending from (0,0) to (1,1) that one has to let go of, and this can be difficult.

I am not aware of any direct evidence that radiologists can move the operating point continuously in the range (0,0) to (1,1) in search tasks, so the existence of such an ROC is tantamount to an assumption. Algorithmic observers that do not involve the element of search can extend continuously to (1,1). An example of an algorithmic observer not involving search is a diagnostic test that rates the results of a laboratory measurement, e.g., the A1C measure of blood glucose for presence of a disease. If A1C ≥ 6.5\% the patient is diagnosed as diabetic. By moving the threshold from infinity to --infinity, and assuming a large population of patients, one can trace out the entire ROC curve from the origin to (1,1). This is because every patient yields an A1C value. Now imagine that some finite fraction of the test results are ``lost in the mail''; then the ROC curve, calculated over all patients, would have the constrained end-point property, albeit due to an unreasonable cause.

The situation in medical imaging involving search tasks is qualitatively different. Not every case yields a decision variable. There is a reasonable cause for this -- to render a decision variable sample the radiologist must find something suspicious to report, and if none is found, there is no decision variable to report. The ROC curve calculated over all patients would exhibit the constrained end-point property, even in the limit of an infinite number of patients. If calculated over only those patients that yielded at least one mark, the ROC curve would extend from (0,0) to (1,1) but then one would be ignoring the cases with no marks, which represent valuable information: unmarked non-diseased cases represent perfect decisions and unmarked diseased cases represent worst-case decisions.

ROC, FROC and AFROC curves were derived (wAFROC is implemented in the Rjafroc). These were used to demonstrate that the FROC is a poor descriptor of performance. Since almost all work to date, including some by me TBA 47,48, has used FROC curves to measure performance, this is going to be difficulty for some to accept. The examples in Fig. 17.6 (A- F) and Fig. 17.7 (A-B) should convince one that the FROC curve is indeed a poor measure of performance. The only situation where one can safely use the FROC curve is if the two modalities produce curves extending over the same NLF range. This can happen with two variants of a CAD algorithm, but rarely with radiologist observers.

A unique feature is that the RSM provides measures of search and lesion-classification performance. It bears repeating that search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions. Search performance can be determined from the position of the ROC end-point (which in turn is determined by RSM-based fitting of ROC data, Chapter 19). The perpendicular distance between the end-point and the chance diagonal is, apart from a factor of 1.414, a measure of search performance. All ROC models that predict continuous curves extending to (1,1), imply zero search performance.

Lesion-classification performance is measured by the AUC value corresponding to the parameter. Lesion-classification performance is the ability to discriminate between LLs and NLs, not between diseased and non-diseased cases: the latter is measured by RSM-AUC. There is a close analogy between the two ways of measuring lesion-classification performance and CAD used to find lesions in screening mammography vs.~CAD used in the diagnostic context to determine if a lesion found at screening is actually malignant. The former is termed CADe, for CAD detection, which in my opinion, is slightly misleading as at screening lesions are found not detected (``detection'' is ``discover or identify the presence or existence of something'', correct localization is not necessarily implied; the more precise term is ``localize''). In the diagnostic context one has CADx, for CAD diagnostic, i.e., given a specific region of the image, is the region malignant?

Search and lesion-classification performance can be used as ``diagnostic aids'' to optimize performance of a reader. For example, is search performance is low, then training using mainly non-diseased cases is called for, so the resident learns the different variants of non-diseased tissues that can appear to be true lesions. If lesion-classification performance is low then training with diseased cases only is called for, so the resident learns the distinguishing features characterizing true lesions from non-diseased tissues that fake true lesions.

Finally, evidence for the RSM is summarized. Its correspondence to the empirical Kundel-Nodine model of visual search that is grounded in eye-tracking measurements. It reduces in the limit of large , which guarantees that every case will yield a decision variable sample, to the binormal model; the predicted pdfs in this limit are not strictly normal, but deviations from normality would require very large sample size to demonstrate. Examples were given where even with 1200 cases the binormal model provides statistically good fits, as judged by the chi-square goodness of fit statistic, Table 17.2. Since the binormal model has proven quite successful in describing a large body of data, it satisfying that the RSM can mimic it in the limit of large . The RSM explains most empirical results regarding binormal model fits: the common finding that b \textless{} 1; that b decreases with increasing lesion pSNR (large and / or ); and the finding that the difference in means divided by the difference in standard deviations is fairly constant for a fixed experimental situation, Table 17.3. The RSM explains data degeneracy, especially for radiologists with high expertise.

The contaminated binormal model2-4 (CBM), Chapter 20, which models the diseased distribution as having two peaks, one at zero and the other at a constrained value, also explains the empirical observation that b-parameter \textless{} 1 and data degeneracy. Because it allows the ROC curve to go continuously to (1,1), CBM does not completely account for search performance -- it accounts for search when it comes to finding lesions, but not for avoiding finding non-lesions.

I do not want to leave the impression that RSM is the ultimate model. The current model does not predict satisfaction of search (SOS) effects27-29. Attempts to incorporate SOS effects in the RSM are in the early research stage. As stated earlier, the RSM is a first-order model: a lot of interesting science remains to be uncovered.

\subsection{The Wagner review}\label{the-wagner-review}}

The two RSM papers12,13 were honored by being included in a list of 25 papers the ``Highlights of 2006'' in Physics in Medicine and Biology. As stated by the publisher: "I am delighted to present a special collection of articles that highlight the very best research published in Physics in Medicine and Biology in 2006. Articles were selected for their presentation of outstanding new research, receipt of the highest praise from our international referees, and the highest number of downloads from the journal website.

One of the reviewers was the late Dr.~Robert (``Bob'') Wagner -- he had an open-minded approach to imaging science that is lacking these days, and a unique writing style. I reproduces one of his comments with minor edits, as it pertains to the most interesting and misunderstood prediction of the RSM, namely its constrained end-point property.

I'm thinking here about the straight-line piece of the ROC curve from the max to (1, 1).
1. This can be thought of as resulting from two overlapping uniform distributions (thus guessing) far to the left in decision space (rather than delta functions). Please think some more about this point--because it might make better contact with the classical literature.
2. BTW -- it just occurs to me (based on the classical early ROC work of Swets \& co.) -- that there is a test that can resolve the issue that I struggled with in my earlier remarks. The experimenter can try to force the reader to provide further data that will fill in the space above the max point. If the results are a dashed straight line, then the reader would just be guessing -- as implied by the present model. If the results are concave downward, then further information has been extracted from the data. This could require a great amount of data to sort out--but it's an interesting point (at least to me).

Dr.~Wagner made two interesting points. With his passing, I have been deprived of the penetrating and incisive evaluation of his ongoing work, which I deeply miss. Here is my response (ca. 2006):

The need for delta functions at negative infinity can be seen from the following argument. Let us postulate two constrained width pdfs with the same shapes but different areas, centered at a common value far to the left in decision space, but not at negative infinity. These pdfs would also yield a straight-line portion to the ROC curve. However, they would be inconsistent with the search model assumption that some images yield no decision variable samples and therefore cannot be rated in bin ROC:2 or higher. Therefore, if the distributions are as postulated above then choice of a cutoff in the neighborhood of the overlap would result in some of these images being rated 2 or higher, contradicting the RSM assumption. The delta function pdfs at negative infinity are seen to be a consequence of the search model.

One could argue that when the observer sees nothing to report then he starts guessing and indeed this would enable the observer to move along the dashed portion of the curve. This argument implies that the observer knows when the threshold is at negative infinity, at which point the observer turns on the guessing mechanism (the observer who always guesses would move along the chance diagonal). In my judgment, this is unreasonable. The existence of two thresholds, one for moving along the non-guessing portion and one for switching to the guessing mode would require abandoning the concept of a single decision rule. To preserve this concept one needs the delta functions at negative infinity.

Regarding Dr.~Wagner's second point, it would require a great amount of data to sort out whether forcing the observer to guess would fill in the dashed portion of the curve, but I doubt it is worth the effort. Given the bad consequences of guessing (incorrect recalls) I believe that in the clinical situation, the radiologist will not knowingly guess. If the radiologist sees nothing to report, nothing will be reported. In addition, I believe that forcing the observer, to prove some research point, is not a good idea.

\section{Appendix 1: Proof of continuity of slope at the end-point}\label{rsm-pred-appendix1}}

The following proof is adapted from a document supplied by Dr.~Xuetong Zhai, then ( ca. 2017) a graduate student working under the supervision of the author.

The end point coordinates of the continuous part of ROC curve was derived above, Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf-max} for \(\text{FPF}_{max}\) and Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf-max} for \(\text{TPF}_{max}\). Therefore, the slope \(m_{st}\) of the dashed dashed straight line is:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
m_{st} =& \frac{1-\text{TPF}_{max}}{1-\text{FPF}_{max}}\\
=&\frac{\sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L \left ( 1 - \nu' \right )^L
 \text{exp} \left ( - \lambda' \right )} {\text{exp} \left ( - \lambda' \right )} \\
=& \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L \left ( 1 - \nu' \right )^L  \\
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-slope-st-line}
\end{equation}

On the continuous section, \(g\equiv\text{FPF}\) and \(h\equiv\text{TPF}\) are defined by \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf} and \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf}, respectively. Therefore,

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
g =& 1-\text{exp} \left ( -\lambda' \Phi\left ( -\zeta \right ) \right ) \\
h =& 1-\sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}}f_L \text{exp} \left ( -\lambda' \Phi\left ( -\zeta \right ) \right ) \left ( 1-\nu'\Phi\left ( \mu - \zeta \right ) \right )^{L}
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-pred-slope-eq3}
\end{equation}

Taking the differentials of these functions with respect to \(\zeta\) it follows that the slope of the ROC is given by:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dh}{dg} =& \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}}  f_L \left ( 1-\nu'\Phi\left ( \mu-\zeta \right ) \right )^{L-1}  \times \\
& \left [ \frac{L\nu'\phi\left ( \mu-\zeta \right )}{\lambda'\phi\left ( -\zeta \right )} + \left ( 1-\nu'\Phi \left ( \mu-\zeta \right )\right ) \right ]\\ 
\end{aligned}
\right \} 
\label{eq:rsm-pred-slope-eq4}
\end{equation}

Using the following result:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
& \lim_{\zeta \rightarrow -\infty} \frac{\phi\left ( \mu-\zeta \right )}{\phi\left ( -\zeta \right )} \\ 
=&\lim_{\zeta \rightarrow -\infty} \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\text{exp}\left ( \frac{\left (\mu-\zeta  \right )^2}{2} \right )}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\text{exp}\left ( \frac{-\zeta^2}{2} \right )} \\
=& \lim_{\zeta \rightarrow -\infty} \text{exp}\left ( \frac{\mu\zeta-\mu^2}{2}  \right ) \\
=& 0
\end{aligned}
\right \} 
\label{eq:rsm-pred-slope-eq5}
\end{equation}

it follows that:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
& \lim_{\zeta \rightarrow -\infty} \frac{dh}{dg} \\ 
=& \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L \left ( 1-\nu' \right )^{L-1} \left ( 1-\nu' \right )\\
=& \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L \left ( 1-\nu' \right )^{L} \\
=& m_{st}
\end{aligned}
\right \} 
\label{eq:rsm-pred-slope-eq6}
\end{equation}

This proves that the limiting slope of the continuous section of the ROC curve equals that of the dashed straight line connecting the end-point to (1,1).

\section{Appendix 2: Numerical illustration of continuity}\label{rsm-pred-appendix2}}

The code in this section examines the slope of the ROC curve as one approaches the end-point \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\). The RSM parameter values are \(\mu = 0.5\), \(\lambda = 0.1\) and \(\nu = 0.8\), and twenty percent of the diseased cases have one lesion and 80 percent have 2 lesions, i.e.~\texttt{lesDistr} -\textgreater{} c(0.2, 0.8).

\end{figure}

At first sight the slope appeared to me to be discontinuous at the end-point \footnote{Others have stated a different visual impression.} but this is not true. In fact the slope decreases as one approaches the end-point, and in the limit equals that of the dashed line. This is demonstrated by the next code section which creates a finely-spaced \(\zeta\) array ranging from -3 to -20. These are the points at which the slope is numerically calculated. Two types of calculations were performed - one using standard \texttt{R} double precision arithmetic and one using multiple precision arithmetic. The R-package \texttt{Rmpfr} was used for the latter. For example, the line \texttt{zeta\_mpr\ -\textgreater{}\ mpfr(zeta,\ 2000)} generates a 2000-bit representation of \(\zeta\). All subsequent computations using \texttt{zeta\_mpr} uses multiple precision arithmetic. The computed slopes are saved in two arrays, \texttt{y1}, the standard precision arithmetic slope and \texttt{y2}, the multiple precision arithmetic slope.

The solid black line is the plot, using multiple precision arithmetic, of slope of the ROC curve vs.~\(\zeta\). The dashed blue line is the slope using standard precision arithmetic. The horizontal dashed red line is the slope of the straight line connecting the end-point to (1,1), i.e., 0.4935272. Standard precision arithmetic breaks down below \(\zeta \approx -6\) rapidly falling to illegal values \texttt{Nan} (above \(\zeta \approx -5\) there is little difference between standard and multiple precision). The multiple precision curve approaches the slope of the straight line as \(\zeta\) approaches -20. This confirms numerically the continuity of the slope of the ROC at the end-point.

\section{TBA Introduction}\label{rsm-sc-intro}}

The preceding chapter described the radiological search model (RSM) for FROC data. This chapter describes predictions of the RSM and how they compare with evidence. The starting point is the inferred ROC curve. While mathematically rather complicated, the results are important because they are needed to derive the ROC-likelihood function, which is used to estimate RSM parameters from ROC data in TBA Chapter 19. The preceding sentence should lead the inquisitive reader to the question: \emph{since the ROC paradigm ignores search, how is it possible to derive parameters of a model of search from the ROC curve?} The answer is that the \emph{shape} of the ROC curve contains information about the RSM parameters. It is fundamentally different from predictions of all conventional ROC models: binormal \citep{RN1081}, contaminated binormal model \citep{RN1501}, bigamma \citep{RN100} and proper ROC \citep{metz1999proper}, namely it has a \emph{constrained end-point property}, while all other models predict that the \emph{end-point}, namely the uppermost non-trivial point on the ROC, reached at infinitely low reporting threshold, is (1,1), while the RSM predicts it does not reach (1,1). The nature of search is such that the limiting end-point is constrained to be below and to the left of (1,1). This key difference, allows one to estimate search parameters from ROC data. Next, the RSM is used to predict FROC and AFROC curves. Two following sections show how search performance and lesion-classification performance can be quantified from the location of the ROC end-point. Search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions, and lesion-classification performance is the ability, having found a suspicious region, to correctly classify it; if classified as a NL it would not be marked (in the mind of the observer every mark is a potential LL, albeit at different confidence levels). Note that lesion-classification is different from classification between diseased and non-diseased cases, which is measured by the ROC-AUC. Based on the ROC/FROC/AFROC curve predictions of the RSM, a comparison is presented between area measures that can be calculated from FROC data, and this leads to an important conclusion, namely the FROC curve is a poor descriptor of search performance and that the AFROC/wAFROC are preferred. This will come as a surprise (shock?) to most researchers somewhat familiar with this field, since the overwhelming majority of users of FROC methods, particularly in CAD, have relied on the FROC curve. Finally, evidence for the validity of the RSM is presented.

\section{Location of ROC end-point}\label{rsm-sc-end-point}}

From the previous chapter the coordinates of the end-point are given by:

\begin{equation}
\left.

&\text{FPF}_{max} = 1 - exp\left (\lambda' \right ) \\
&\text{TPF}_{max} \left ( \mu, \lambda', \nu', L \right ) = 1 - \sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}}f_L\text{exp} \left ( - \lambda' \right ) \left ( 1 - \nu' \right )^L

\section{Quantifying search performance}\label{rsm-sc-quantifying}}

Qualitatively, search performance is the ability to find lesions while not finding non-lesions. To arrive at a quantitative definition of search performance consider the location of the ROC end-point.

In Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-sc-performance-from-roc-curve}, plot (a) is a typical ROC curve predicted by models that do not account for search. The end-point is at (1,1), the filled circle, i.e., by adopting a sufficiently low reporting threshold the observer can continuously move the operating point to (1,1).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{08-rsm-search_files/figure-latex/rsm-sc-performance-from-roc-curve-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:rsm-sc-performance-from-roc-curve}Relation of search performance to the end-point of the ROC curve. Plot (a) is for conventional ROC models while plot (b) is for the RSM.}
\end{figure}

The curve labeled (b) is a typical RSM-predicted ROC curve. The end-point is down-left shifted relative to (1,1), the filled square. The observer cannot move the operating point continuously to (1,1). \emph{The location of the end-point, in particular how far it is from (1,1), measures search performance.} Higher search performance is characterized by the end-point moving upwards and to the left, in the limit to (0,1), corresponding to perfect search performance.

\textbf{Definition}: The perpendicular distance, \(d_S\), from the end-point to the chance diagonal, plot (c), multiplied by \(\sqrt{2}\), is a quantitative measure of search performance \(S\).

Using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_from_a_point_to_a_line\#Line_defined_by_an_equation}{geometry} and Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-sc-FPF-TPF-max}, it follows that:

\begin{equation} 
S=\sqrt{2}d_S=\text{TPF}_{max}-\text{FPF}_{max}
\label{eq:rsm-sc-perp-distance}
\end{equation}

Therefore, search performance \(S\) is given by:

\begin{equation} 
S=\exp\left ( -\lambda' \right )\left (1-\sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}}f_L\left ( 1-\nu'  \right )^L  \right )
\label{eq:rsm-sc-search-performance}
\end{equation}

Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-sc-search-performance} shows search performance is the product of two terms: the probability \(\left (1-\sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}}f_L\left ( 1-\nu' \right )^L \right )\) of finding at least one lesion times the probability \(\exp\left ( -\lambda' \right )\) of not finding non-lesions. This puts into mathematical form the qualitative definition of search performance as the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions.

Example: consider \(\lambda' = 0\) and \(\nu' = 1\). The end-point is (0,1). The perpendicular distance from (0,1) to the chance diagonal is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), which multiplied by \(\sqrt{2}\) yields \(S = 1\). The same value is obtained using Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-sc-search-performance}. Since no NLs are found and all lesions are found, the observer never makes a mistake. One cannot improve over perfect performance: the observer simply marks all suspiciuos regions found by search regardless of their z-samples.

\hypertarget{rsm-sc-performance}{%
\section{Quantifying lesion-classification performance}\label{rsm-sc-performance}}

Lesion-classification performance \(C\) measures the ability, having found a suspicious region, to correctly classify it as a lesion, i.e., mark the location of the lesion resulting in a LL event. It is distinct from \emph{case-classification} performance, ROC AUC, which measures the ability to distinguish between diseased and non-diseased cases. In contrast \emph{lesion-classification} performance is a measure of the ability to distinguish between diseased and non-diseased regions, i.e., between latent NLs and latent LLs. Lesion-classification performance \(C\) is determined by the \(\mu\) parameter of the RSM and is defined by the implied ROC-area of two unit variance normal distributions separated by \(\mu\).

\begin{equation}
C=\Phi\left ( \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{2}} \right )
\label{eq:rsm-sc-classification-performance}
\end{equation}

\(C\) ranges from 0.5 to 1.

\hypertarget{rsm-sc-search-classification-2afc-lke}{%
\subsection{TBA Lesion-classification performance and the 2AFC LKE task}\label{rsm-sc-search-classification-2afc-lke}}

It should be obvious that lesion-classification performance is similar to what is measured using the location-known-exactly (LKE) paradigm. In this paradigm, one uses 2AFC methods as in TBA Fig. 4.3, but one could use the ratings method as long as the lesion is cued (i.e., pointed to). On diseased cases, the lesion is cued, but to control for false positives, one must also cue a similar region on non-diseased cases, as in TBA Fig. 4.3. In that figure, the lesion, present in one of the two images, is always in the center of one of the two fields. Sometimes cross hairs are used to indicate where the observer should be looking. The probability of a correct choice in the 2AFC task is , i.e., AUC conditioned on the (possible) position of the lesion being cued. Since the lesion is cued, search performance of the observer is irrelevant, and one expects . The reason for the inequality is that on a non-diseased case, the location being cued, in all likelihood, does not correspond to a latent NL found by the observer's search mechanism. Latent NLs are more suspicious for disease than other locations in the case. measures the separation parameter between latent NLs and LLs. The separation parameter between latent LLs and a researcher chosen location is likely to be larger. This is because latent NLs are more suspicious for disease than a researcher chosen location. It is known that performance under this condition exceeds that in a free-search 2AFC or ROC study, denoted AUC, where the lesion is not cued and it could be anywhere. This should be obvious -- pointing to the possible location of the lesion takes out the need for searching the rest of the image, which introduces the possibility of not finding the lesion and / or finding non-lesions. One expects the following ordering: . is expected to be the least, as there is uncertainty about possible lesion location. is expected to be next in order, as now uncertainty has been reduced, and the observer's task is to pick between two cued locations, one a latent NL and the other a latent LL. is expected to be highest, as now the observer's task is to pick between two cued locations, one a latent LL and the other a researcher chosen location, most likely not a latent NL. Data supporting the expected inequality is presented in §19.5.4.6.

\hypertarget{rsm-sc-search-classification-significance}{%
\subsection{Significance of measuring search and lesion-classification performance}\label{rsm-sc-search-classification-significance}}

The ability to quantify search and lesion-classification performance from a single paradigm (ROC) study is highly significant, going well-beyond modeling the ROC curve. ROC-AUC measures how well an observer is able to separate two groups of patients, a group of diseased patients from a group of non-diseased patients. While important, it does not inform us about how the observer goes about doing this and what is limiting the observer's performance.

In contrast, the search and lesion-classification measures described above can be used as an optimization-aid in determining what is limiting performance. If search performance \(S\) is poor it indicates that the observer needs to be trained on more \emph{non-diseased} cases to learn the variants of non-diseased anatomy so as not to confuse them for lesions. On the other hand, if lesion-classification performance \$\$ is poor, then one needs to train the observer using images where the location of a possible lesion is cued, and the observer's task is to determine if the cued location is a real lesion. In breast CAD since the designer level ROC curve goes almost all the way to (1,1) implying poor search performance. Therefore more research is needed on improving CAD's search performance. In contrast lCAD's esion-classification performance could actually be quite good, because CAD has access to the pixel values and the ability to apply complex algorithms to properly classify lesions as benign or malignant.

To realize these benefits one needs a way of estimating the ROC end-point shown. TBA Chapter 19 describes RSM based curve fitting which determines all parameters of the RSM, thereby determining the location of the end-point TBA.

\hypertarget{rsm-sc-discussion-summary}{%
\section{Discussion / Summary}\label{rsm-sc-discussion-summary}}

TBA This chapter has detailed ROC, FROC and AFROC curves predicted by the radiological search model (RSM). All RSM-predicted curves share the constrained end-point property that is qualitatively different from previous ROC models. In my experience, it is a property that most researchers in this field have difficulty accepting. There is too much history going back to the early 1940s, of the ROC curve extending from (0,0) to (1,1) that one has to let go of, and this can be difficult.

TBA I am not aware of any direct evidence that radiologists can move the operating point continuously in the range (0,0) to (1,1) in search tasks, so the existence of such an ROC is tantamount to an assumption. Algorithmic observers that do not involve the element of search can extend continuously to (1,1). An example of an algorithmic observer not involving search is a diagnostic test that rates the results of a laboratory measurement, e.g., the A1C measure of blood glucose for presence of a disease. If A1C ≥ 6.5\% the patient is diagnosed as diabetic. By moving the threshold from infinity to --infinity, and assuming a large population of patients, one can trace out the entire ROC curve from the origin to (1,1). This is because every patient yields an A1C value. Now imagine that some finite fraction of the test results are ``lost in the mail''; then the ROC curve, calculated over all patients, would have the constrained end-point property, albeit due to an unreasonable cause.

The situation in medical imaging involving search tasks is qualitatively different. Not every case yields a decision variable. There is a reasonable cause for this -- to render a decision variable sample the radiologist must find something suspicious to report, and if none is found, there is no decision variable to report. The ROC curve calculated over all patients would exhibit the constrained end-point property, even in the limit of an infinite number of patients. If calculated over only those patients that yielded at least one mark, the ROC curve would extend from (0,0) to (1,1) but then one would be ignoring the cases with no marks, which represent valuable information: unmarked non-diseased cases represent perfect decisions and unmarked diseased cases represent worst-case decisions.

RSM-predicted ROC, FROC and AFROC curves were derived (wAFROC is implemented in the Rjafroc). These were used to demonstrate that the FROC is a poor descriptor of performance. Since almost all work to date, including some by me 47,48, has used FROC curves to measure performance, this is going to be difficulty for some to accept. The examples in Fig. 17.6 (A- F) and Fig. 17.7 (A-B) should convince one that the FROC curve is indeed a poor measure of performance. The only situation where one can safely use the FROC curve is if the two modalities produce curves extending over the same NLF range. This can happen with two variants of a CAD algorithm, but rarely with radiologist observers.

A unique feature is that the RSM provides measures of search and lesion-classification performance. It bears repeating that search performance is the ability to find lesions while avoiding finding non-lesions. Search performance can be determined from the position of the ROC end-point (which in turn is determined by RSM-based fitting of ROC data, Chapter 19). The perpendicular distance between the end-point and the chance diagonal is, apart from a factor of 1.414, a measure of search performance. All ROC models that predict continuous curves extending to (1,1), imply zero search performance.

Lesion-classification performance is measured by the AUC value corresponding to the parameter. Lesion-classification performance is the ability to discriminate between LLs and NLs, not between diseased and non-diseased cases: the latter is measured by RSM-AUC. There is a close analogy between the two ways of measuring lesion-classification performance and CAD used to find lesions in screening mammography vs.~CAD used in the diagnostic context to determine if a lesion found at screening is actually malignant. The former is termed CADe, for CAD detection, which in my opinion, is slightly misleading as at screening lesions are found not detected (``detection'' is ``discover or identify the presence or existence of something'', correct localization is not necessarily implied; the more precise term is ``localize''). In the diagnostic context one has CADx, for CAD diagnostic, i.e., given a specific region of the image, is the region malignant?

Search and lesion-classification performance can be used as ``diagnostic aids'' to optimize performance of a reader. For example, is search performance is low, then training using mainly non-diseased cases is called for, so the resident learns the different variants of non-diseased tissues that can appear to be true lesions. If lesion-classification performance is low then training with diseased cases only is called for, so the resident learns the distinguishing features characterizing true lesions from non-diseased tissues that fake true lesions.

Finally, evidence for the RSM is summarized. Its correspondence to the empirical Kundel-Nodine model of visual search that is grounded in eye-tracking measurements. It reduces in the limit of large , which guarantees that every case will yield a decision variable sample, to the binormal model; the predicted pdfs in this limit are not strictly normal, but deviations from normality would require very large sample size to demonstrate. Examples were given where even with 1200 cases the binormal model provides statistically good fits, as judged by the chi-square goodness of fit statistic, Table 17.2. Since the binormal model has proven quite successful in describing a large body of data, it satisfying that the RSM can mimic it in the limit of large . The RSM explains most empirical results regarding binormal model fits: the common finding that b \textless{} 1; that b decreases with increasing lesion pSNR (large and / or ); and the finding that the difference in means divided by the difference in standard deviations is fairly constant for a fixed experimental situation, Table 17.3. The RSM explains data degeneracy, especially for radiologists with high expertise.

The contaminated binormal model2-4 (CBM), Chapter 20, which models the diseased distribution as having two peaks, one at zero and the other at a constrained value, also explains the empirical observation that b-parameter \textless{} 1 and data degeneracy. Because it allows the ROC curve to go continuously to (1,1), CBM does not completely account for search performance -- it accounts for search when it comes to finding lesions, but not for avoiding finding non-lesions.

I do not want to leave the impression that RSM is the ultimate model. The current model does not predict satisfaction of search (SOS) effects27-29. Attempts to incorporate SOS effects in the RSM are in the early research stage. As stated earlier, the RSM is a first-order model: a lot of interesting science remains to be uncovered.

\hypertarget{the-wagner-review-1}{%
\subsection{The Wagner review}\label{the-wagner-review-1}}

The two RSM papers12,13 were honored by being included in a list of 25 papers the ``Highlights of 2006'' in Physics in Medicine and Biology. As stated by the publisher: "I am delighted to present a special collection of articles that highlight the very best research published in Physics in Medicine and Biology in 2006. Articles were selected for their presentation of outstanding new research, receipt of the highest praise from our international referees, and the highest number of downloads from the journal website.

One of the reviewers was the late Dr.~Robert (``Bob'') Wagner -- he had an open-minded approach to imaging science that is lacking these days, and a unique writing style. I reproduce one of his comments with minor edits, as it pertains to the most interesting and misunderstood prediction of the RSM, namely its constrained end-point property.

I'm thinking here about the straight-line piece of the ROC curve from the max to (1, 1).
1. This can be thought of as resulting from two overlapping uniform distributions (thus guessing) far to the left in decision space (rather than delta functions). Please think some more about this point--because it might make better contact with the classical literature.
2. BTW -- it just occurs to me (based on the classical early ROC work of Swets \& co.) -- that there is a test that can resolve the issue that I struggled with in my earlier remarks. The experimenter can try to force the reader to provide further data that will fill in the space above the max point. If the results are a straight line, then the reader would just be guessing -- as implied by the present model. If the results are concave downward, then further information has been extracted from the data. This could require a great amount of data to sort out--but it's an interesting point (at least to me).

Dr.~Wagner made two interesting points. With his passing, I have been deprived of the penetrating and incisive evaluation of his ongoing work, which I deeply miss. Here is my response (ca. 2006):

The need for delta functions at negative infinity can be seen from the following argument. Let us postulate two constrained width pdfs with the same shapes but different areas, centered at a common value far to the left in decision space, but not at negative infinity. These pdfs would also yield a straight-line portion to the ROC curve. However, they would be inconsistent with the search model assumption that some images yield no decision variable samples and therefore cannot be rated in bin ROC:2 or higher. Therefore, if the distributions are as postulated above then choice of a cutoff in the neighborhood of the overlap would result in some of these images being rated 2 or higher, contradicting the RSM assumption. The delta function pdfs at negative infinity are seen to be a consequence of the search model.

One could argue that when the observer sees nothing to report then he starts guessing and indeed this would enable the observer to move along the dashed portion of the curve. This argument implies that the observer knows when the threshold is at negative infinity, at which point the observer turns on the guessing mechanism (the observer who always guesses would move along the chance diagonal). In my judgment, this is unreasonable. The existence of two thresholds, one for moving along the non-guessing portion and one for switching to the guessing mode would require abandoning the concept of a single decision rule. To preserve this concept one needs the delta functions at negative infinity.

Regarding Dr.~Wagner's second point, it would require a great amount of data to sort out whether forcing the observer to guess would fill in the dashed portion of the curve, but I doubt it is worth the effort. Given the bad consequences of guessing (incorrect recalls) I believe that in the clinical situation, the radiologist will never guess. If the radiologist sees nothing to report, nothing will be reported. In addition, I believe that forcing the observer, to prove some research point, is not a good idea.

\section{TBA Introduction}\label{rsm-fitting-intro}}

The radiological search model (RSM) is based on what is known, via eye-tracking measurements, about how radiologists look at medical images \citep{kundel2004modeling}. The ability of this model to predict search and lesion-classification expertise was described in TBA Chapter 17. If one could estimate search and lesion-classification expertise from clinical datasets then one would know which of them is limiting performance. This would provide insight into the decision making efficiency of observers. For this potential to be realized, one has to be able to reliably estimate parameters of the RSM from data, and this turned out to be a difficult problem.

To put progress in this area in context a brief historical background is needed. I have worked on and off on the FROC estimation problem since 2002, and two persons (Dr.~Hong-Jun Yoon and Xuetong Zhai) can attest to the effort. Initial attempts focused on fitting the FROC curve, in the (subsequently shown to be mistaken) belief that this was using \emph{all} the data. In fact unmarked non-diseased cases, which are perfect decisions, are not taken into account in the FROC plot. In addition, there are degeneracy issues, which make parameter estimation difficult except in uninteresting situations. Early work involved maximization of the FROC likelihood function. This method was applied to seven designer-level CAD datasets. With CAD data one has a large number of marks and unmarked cases are relatively rare. However, only the CAD designer knows of their existence since in the clinic only a small fraction of the marks, those whose z-samples exceed a manufacturer-selected threshold, are actually shown to the radiologist. In other words the full FROC curve, extending to the end-point, is available to the CAD algorithm designer, which makes estimation of the end-point defining parameters \(\lambda', \nu'\) trivial. Estimating the remaining parameter of the RSM is then also relatively easy.

It was gradually recognized that the FROC curve based method worked only for designer level CAD data, and not for human observer data. Consequently, subsequent effort focused on ROC curve-based fitting, and this proved successful at fitting radiologist datasets, where detailed definition of the ROC curve is not available. A preliminary account of this work can be found in a conference proceeding \citep{RN2125}.

\emph{The reader should be surprised to read that the research eventually turned to ROC curve based fitting, which implies that one does not even need FROC data to estimate RSM parameters.} I have previously stated that the ROC paradigm ignores search, so how can one estimate search-model parameters from ROC data? The reason is that the \emph{shape} of the ROC curve and the \emph{position} of the upper-most observed operating point, depend on the RSM parameters, and this information can be used for a successful fitting method that is not susceptible to degeneracy \footnote{Degenerate datasets are defined as those that do not provide any interior data points, i.e., all operating points lie on the edges of the ROC square, i.e., enclosed by the four lines defined by FPF = 0 or 1 and TPF = 0 or 1.}.

The chapter starts with fitting FROC curves. This is partly for historical reasons and to make contact with a method used by CAD designers. Then focus shifts to fitting ROC curves and comparing the RSM-based method to existing methods, namely the proper ROC (PROPROC) \citep{metz1999proper, RN2413} and the contaminated binormal model (CBM) \citep{RN1501} methods, both of which are proper ROC fitting models. These are described in more detail in TBA Chapter 20. The comparison is based on a large number of interpretations, namely, 14 datasets comprising 43 modalities, 80 readers and 2012 cases, most of which are from my international collaborations. Besides providing further evidence for the validity of the RSM, the estimates of search and lesion-classification performance derived from the fitted parameters demonstrate that there is information in ROC data that is currently ignored by analyses that do not account for search performance. \emph{Specifically, it shows that search performance is the bottleneck that is currently limiting radiologist performance.}

The ability to fit RSM to clinical datasets is critical to sample size estimation -- this was the practical reason why the RSM fitting problem had to be solved. Sample size estimation requires relating the wAFROC-AUC FOM to the corresponding ROC-AUC FOM in order to obtain a physically meaningful effect-size. Lacking a mathematical relationship between them, comparing the effect-sizes in the two units would be like comparing ``apples and oranges''. A mathematical relation is only possible if one has a parametric model that predicts both ROC and wAFROC curves, as does the RSM. Therefore, this chapter concludes with sample size estimation for FROC studies using the wAFROC FOM. However, as long as one can predict the appropriate operating characteristic using RSM parameters, the method can be extended to other paradigms, e.g., the location ROC (LROC) \citep{RN1654} paradigm.

\section{ROC Likelihood function}\label{rsm-fitting-roc-likelihood}}

In Chapter \ref{rsm-pred} expressions were derived for the coordinates (x,y) of the ROC curve predicted by the RSM, see Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-fpf} and Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-pred-tpf}.

\begin{equation}
x \equiv \text{FPF}\left (\zeta , \lambda'\right ) = 1 - \text{exp}\left ( -\lambda' \Phi\left ( -\zeta \right )  \right )
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-fpf}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
y \equiv & \text{TPF}\left (\zeta , \mu, \lambda', \nu', \overrightarrow{f_L} \right ) =  \\
& 1 - \text{exp}\left ( -\lambda' \Phi \left ( -\zeta \right )\right ) 
\sum_{L=1}^{L_{max}} f_L  \left ( 1 - \nu' \Phi \left ( \mu -\zeta \right ) \right )^L 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-tpf}
\end{equation}

Let \((F_r,T_r)\) denote the number of false positives and true positives, respectively, in ROC rating bin \(r\) defined by thresholds \([\zeta_r, \zeta_{r+1})\), for \(r = 0, 1, ..., R_{FROC}\). The range of \(r\) shows explicitly that \(R_{FROC}\) FROC ratings correspond to \(R_{FROC}+1\) ROC bins \footnote{The rating bookkeeping can be confusing. Basically, \(r = 0\) corresponds to unmarked cases, \(r = 1\) corresponds to cases where the highest rated FROC mark was rated 1, etc., and \(r = R_{FROC}\) corresponds to cases where the highest rated FROC mark was rated \(R_{FROC}\).}. Note that \((F_0,T_0)\) represent the \emph{known} numbers of non-diseased and diseased cases, respectively, with no marks, \((F_1,T_1)\) represent the numbers of non-diseased and diseased cases, respectively, with highest rating equal to one, etc. The probability \(P_{1r}\) of a count in non-diseased ROC bin \(r\) is \footnote{One needs to subtract the CDF evaluated at \(r+1\) from that at \(r\); the CDF is the complement of x, which results in the reversal. It should also make sense because the higher indexed x is to the right of the lower indexed one. Recall that the operating points are numbered starting from the top-right and working down.} :

\begin{equation}
P_{1r} = x\left ( \zeta_r \right ) - x\left ( \zeta_{r+1} \right )\\ 
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-roc-p1r}
\end{equation}

Likewise, the probability \(P_{2r}\) of a count in diseased ROC bin \(r\) is:

\begin{equation}
P_{2r} = y\left ( \zeta_r \right ) - y\left ( \zeta_{r+1} \right )\\ 
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-roc-p2r}
\end{equation}

Ignoring combinatorial factors that do not depend on parameters the likelihood function is:

\[\left ( P_{1r} \right )^{F_r}  \left ( P_{2r} \right )^{T_r}\]

The log-likelihood function is:

\begin{equation}
LL_{ROC} \left ( \mu, \lambda', \nu', \overrightarrow{f_L} \right )= \sum_{r=0}^{R_{FROC}} \left [F_r log \left (P_{1r}  \right ) + T_r log \left (P_{2r}  \right )  \right ] \\
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-roc-ll2}
\end{equation}

The total number of parameters to be estimated, including the \(R_{FROC}\) thresholds, is \(3+R_{FROC}\). Maximizing the likelihood function yields estimates of the RSM parameters.

The Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno (BFGS) \citep{RN2646, RN2647, RN2648, RN2649, RN2651, RN2650} minimization algorithm, as implemented as function \texttt{mle2()} in R-package \texttt{bbmle} \citep{packageBbmle} was used to minimize the negative of the likelihood function. Since the BFGS-algorithm varies each parameter in an unrestricted range \((-\infty, \infty)\), which would cause problems (e.g., RSM physical parameters cannot be negative and thresholds need to be properly ordered), appropriate variable transformations (both ``forward'' and ``inverse'') were used so that parameters supplied to the log-likelihood function were always in the valid range, irrespective of values chosen by the BFGS-algorithm.

The software also calculates the goodness of fit statistic using the method described in \texttt{RJafrocRocBook}. Because of the additional RSM parameter (as compared to conventional ROC models) the degrees-of-freedom (df) of the chisquare goodness of fit statistic is \(R_{FROC} – 3\). Calculating goodness of fit for the RSM can fail in situations where the corresponding statistic can be calculated for the binormal model, e.g., three (non -- trivial) ROC operating points, corresponding to \(\text{df} = 1\). With RSM fitting one needs at least four (non -- trivial) ROC operating points, each defined by bins with at least five counts in both non-diseased and diseased categories. \footnote{With three operating points, each defined by bins with at least five counts in both non-diseased and diseased categories, the number of usable ROC bins is four. Subtracting three one gets \(df = 1\), and the statistic can be calculated using an ROC model. However, because of the extra RSM parameter, the corresponding RSM \(\text{df} = 0\), and the chi-square statistic cannot be calculated.}

  The following example uses the \emph{first} treatment in \texttt{dataset04}; this is a 5 treatment 4 radiologist FROC dataset \citep{zanca2009evaluation} consisting of 200 cases acquired on a 5-point integer scale, i.e., it is already binned. If not one needs to bin the dataset using \texttt{DfBinDataset()}. The number of parameters to be estimated increases with the number of bins: for each additional bin one needs to estimate an additional cutoff parameter.
\end{itemize}

The lesion distribution vector is 0.69, 0.2, 0.11. This means that fraction 0.69 of each diseased case contains one lesion, fraction 0.2 contains two lesions and fraction 0.11 contains three lesions. Since the fitted curve depends on the lesion distribution the fitting function needs to know this distribution. \footnote{For example, all else being equal, if each diseased case contains one lesion the ROC curve will be lower than if each diseased case contains three lesions.}

The fitted parameter values are as follows (all cutoffs excepting \(\zeta_1\), the chi-square statistic - \texttt{NA} for this dataset - and the covariance matrix, are not shown):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\mu\) = 3.655
\item
  \(\lambda'\) = 9.873
\item
  \(\nu'\) = 0.796
\item
  \(\zeta_1\) = 1.501
\item
  \(\text{AUC}\) = 0.9065
\item
  \(\sigma (\text{AUC})\) = 0.023
\item
  \(\text{NLLIni}\) = 281.4
\item
  \(\text{NLLFin}\) = 267.27
\end{itemize}

The relatively large separation parameter \(\mu\) implies good lesion-classification performance. The large \(\lambda'\) parameter implies poor search performance. On the average the observer generates 9.87 latent NL marks per image. However, because of the relatively large value of \(\zeta_1\), i.e., 1.5, only fraction 0.067 of these are actually marked, resulting in 0.66 actual marks per image. Search performance depends on the numbers of latent marks, i.e., \(\lambda'\) and \(\nu'\), not the actual numbers of marks.

The fitting program decreased the negative of the log-likelihood function from 281.4 to 267.27. A decrease in negative log-likelihood is equivalent to an increase in the likelihood, which is as expected, as the function maximizes the log-likelihood.

Because the RSM contains 3 parameters, which is one more that conventionql ROC models, the chisquare goodness of fit statistic usually cannot be calculated, except for large datasets - the criterion of 5 counts in each bin for true positives and false positives is usually hard to meet.

Shown next is the fitted plot. Error bars (exact 95\% confidence intervals) are shown for the lowest and highest operating points.

\includegraphics{09-rsm-fitting_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf}

The fitted ROC curve is proper: it's slope decreases monotonically as one moves up the curve thereby ruling out hooks such as are predicted by the binormal model. TBA The area under the proper ROC is 0.907 which will be shown in a subsequent chapter to be identical to that yielded by other proper ROC fitting methods and higher than the binormal model fitted value.

\hypertarget{rsm-fitting-discussion-summary}{%
\section{TBA Discussion / Summary}\label{rsm-fitting-discussion-summary}}

Over the years, there have been several attempts at fitting FROC data. Prior to the RSM-based ROC curve approach described in this chapter, all methods were aimed at fitting FROC curves, in the mistaken belief that this approach was using all the data. The earliest was my FROCFIT software 36. This was followed by Swensson's approach 37, subsequently shown to be equivalent to my earlier work, as far as predicting the FROC curve was concerned 11. In the meantime, CAD developers, who relied heavily on the FROC curve to evaluate their algorithms, developed an empirical approach that was subsequently put on a formal basis in the IDCA method 12.

This chapter describes an approach to fitting ROC curves, instead of FROC curves, using the RSM. On the face of it, fitting the ROC curve seems to be ignoring much of the data. As an example, the ROC rating on a non-diseased case is the rating of the highest-rated mark on that image, or negative infinity if the case has no marks. If the case has several NL marks, only the highest rated one is used. In fact the highest rated mark contains information about the other marks on the case, namely they were all rated lower. There is a statistical term for this, namely sufficiency 38. As an example, the highest of a number of samples from a uniform distribution is a sufficient statistic, i.e., it contains all the information contained in the observed samples. While not quite the same for normally distributed values, neglect of the NLs rated lower is not as bad as might seem at first.

\hypertarget{rsm-fitting-froc-likelihood}{%
\section{Appendix 1: FROC likelihood function}\label{rsm-fitting-froc-likelihood}}

Recall that the likelihood function is the probability of observing the data as a function of the parameter values. FROC notation was summarized in TBA Table 13.1. Thresholds \(\overrightarrow{\zeta } \equiv \left ( \zeta_0, \zeta_1, ..., \zeta_{R_{FROC}+1}, \right )\) were defined, where \(R_{FROC}\) is the number of FROC bins, and \(\zeta_0 = -\infty\) and \(\zeta_{R_{FROC}+1} = \infty\). Since each z-sample is obtained by sampling an appropriately centered unit-variance normal distribution, the probability \(p_r\) that a latent NL will be marked and rated in FROC bin \(r\) and the probability \(q_r\) that a latent LL will be marked and rated in FROC bin \(r\) are given by:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
p_r = & \Phi\left ( \zeta_{r+1} \right ) - \Phi\left ( \zeta_r \right ) \\
q_r = & \Phi\left ( \zeta_{r+1} - \mu \right ) - \Phi\left ( \zeta_r  - \mu \right ) 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-pr-qr}
\end{equation}

Understanding these equations is easy: the CDF function evaluated at a threshold is the probability that a z-sample is less than the threshold. The first equation is the difference between the CDF functions of a unit-normal distribution evaluated at the two thresholds. This is the probability that the NL z-sample falls in bin FROC:\(r\). The second equation gives the probability that the LL z-sample falls in bin FROC:\(r\). The probabilities \(p_r\) and \(q_r\) individually sum to unity when all bins, including the zero bin, are included.

If NL and LL events are assumed independent, the contributions to the likelihood function can be separated, and one need not enumerate counts at the individual case-level; instead, in the description that follows, one enumerates NL and LL counts in the various bins over the whole dataset.

\hypertarget{rsm-fitting-froc-nls}{%
\subsection{Contribution of NLs}\label{rsm-fitting-froc-nls}}

Define \(n\) (a random non-negative integer) as the total number of latent NLs in the dataset. The observed NL counts vector is \(\overrightarrow{n} \equiv \left ( n_0, n_1, ...,n_{R_{FROC}}, \right )\). Here \(n_r\) is the total number of NL counts in FROC ratings bin \(r\), \(n_0 = n - \sum_{r=1}^{R} n_r = n - N\), is the \emph{unknown number of unmarked latent NLs} and \(N\) is the total number of observed NLs in the dataset. The probability \(P\left ( \overrightarrow{n} \mid n, \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right )\) of observing the NL counts vector \(\overrightarrow{n}\) is (the factorials come from the multinomial distribution):

\begin{equation}
P\left ( \overrightarrow{n} \mid n, \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right ) = n! \prod_{r=0}^{R_{FROC}} \frac{p_r^{n_r}}{n_r!}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-pnvector}
\end{equation}

Since \(n\) is a random integer, the probability needs to be averaged over its Poisson distribution, i.e., one is calculating the expected value, yielding:

\begin{equation}
P\left ( \overrightarrow{n} \mid \lambda', \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right ) = \text{pmf}_{\text{Poi}} \left ( n, K\lambda' \right ) P\left ( \overrightarrow{n} \mid n, \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right )
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-p-n-lambda-prime-zeta}
\end{equation}

In this expression \(K = K_1 + K_2\) is the total number of cases. \(\text{pmf}_{\text{Poi}} \left ( n, K\lambda' \right )\) of the Poisson distribution yields the probability of \(n\) counts from a Poisson distribution with mean \(K\lambda'\). The multiplication by the total number of cases is required because one is counting the total number of latent NLs over the entire dataset. The lower limit on \(n\) is needed because \(n\) cannot be smaller than \(N\), the total number of observed NL counts. The left hand side of Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-p-n-lambda-prime-zeta} is the probability of observing the NL counts vector \(\overrightarrow{n}\) as a function of RSM parameters. Not surprisingly, since NLs are sampled from a zero-mean normal distribution, the \(\mu\) parameter does not enter the above expression.

\hypertarget{rsm-fitting-froc-lls}{%
\subsection{Contribution of LLs}\label{rsm-fitting-froc-lls}}

Likewise, define \(l\) (a non-negative random integer) the total number of latent LLs in the dataset and the LL counts vector is \(\overrightarrow{l} \equiv \left ( l_0, l_1, ...,l_{R_{FROC}}, \right )\). Here \(l_r\) is the number of LL counts in FROC ratings bin \(r\), \(l_0 = l - \sum_{r=1}^{R_{FROC}} l_r = l - L\) is the \emph{known} number of unmarked latent LLs and \(L\) is the total number of observed LLs in the dataset. The probability \(P\left ( \overrightarrow{l} \mid l, \mu, \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right )\) of observing the LL counts vector \(\overrightarrow{l}\) is:

\begin{equation}
P\left ( \overrightarrow{l} \mid l, \mu, \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right ) = l! \prod_{r=0}^{R_{FROC}} \frac{q_r^{l_r}}{l_r!}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-plvector}
\end{equation}

The above probability needs to be averaged over the binomial distribution of l:

\begin{equation}
P\left ( \overrightarrow{l} \mid l, \mu, \nu', \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right ) = \sum_{l=L}^{L_{tot}}\text{pmf}_{\text{Bin}} \left ( l, L_T, \nu' \right ) P\left ( \overrightarrow{l} \mid l, \mu, \overrightarrow{\zeta} \right )
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-p-l-mu-nu-prime-zeta}
\end{equation}

In this expression \(L_{tot}\) is the total number of lesions in the dataset and the lower limit on \(l\) is needed because it cannot be smaller than \(L\), the total number of observed LLs. Performing the two summations using Maple, multiplying the two probabilities and taking the logarithm yields the final expression for the log-likelihood function \citep{RN1652}:

\begin{equation}
LL_{FROC} \equiv LL_{FROC}\left ( \overrightarrow{n}, \overrightarrow{l} \mid \mu, \lambda', \nu' \right ) \\
= \sum_{r=1}^{R_{FROC}} \left \{ n_r log\left ( p_r \right ) + l_r log\left ( q_r \right ) \right \} \\
+ N log\left ( \lambda' \right ) \\
+ L log\left ( \nu' \right ) \\
- K \lambda' \left ( 1-p_0 \right ) \\
+ \left ( L_T - L \right ) log \left ( 1 - \nu' + \nu' \ q_0 \right )
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-froc-ll}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{rsm-fitting-froc-degeneracy}{%
\subsection{Degeneracy problems}\label{rsm-fitting-froc-degeneracy}}

The product \(\lambda' \left ( 1-p_0 \right ) = \lambda'\Phi(-\zeta_1)\) reveals degeneracy in the sense that two quantities appear as a product, so that they cannot be individually separated. The effect of increasing \(\lambda'\) can be counteracted by increasing \(\zeta_1\); increasing \(\lambda'\) yields more latent NLs but increasing \(\zeta_1\) results in fewer of them being marked. The two possibilities cannot be distinguished. A similar degeneracy occurs in the term involving the product \(-\nu' + \nu' \ q_0 = -\nu'(1- q_0) = -\nu' \Phi(\mu-\zeta_1)\), where increasing \(\nu'\) can be counter balanced by decreasing \(\mu-\zeta_1\), i.e., by increasing \(\zeta_1\). Again, the effect of increasing \(\nu'\) is to produce more latent LLs, but increasing \(\zeta_1\) results in fewer of them being marked.

\emph{This is the fundamental problem with fitting RSM FROC curves to radiologist FROC data.}

\hypertarget{rsm-fitting-froc-idca}{%
\section{Appendix 2: IDCA Likelihood function}\label{rsm-fitting-froc-idca}}

In the limit \(\zeta_1 \rightarrow -\infty\), \(p_0 \rightarrow 0\) and \(q_0 \rightarrow 0\), and TBA Eqn. (18.6) reduces to:

\begin{equation}
LL_{FROC}^{IDCA} = \sum_{r=1}^{R_{FROC}} \left \{ n_r log\left ( p_r \right ) + l_r log\left ( q_r \right ) \right \} \\
+ N log\left ( \lambda' \right ) \\
+ L log\left ( \nu' \right ) \\
- K \lambda'  \\
+ \left ( L_T - L \right ) log \left ( 1 - \nu'  \right )
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-ll}
\end{equation}

\emph{Notice that in the limit \(\zeta_1 \rightarrow -\infty\) the degeneracy problems just described go away.}

The superscript IDCA comes from \emph{``initial detection and candidate analysis''} \citep{edwards2002maximum}. All CAD algorithms consist of an \emph{initial detection} stage, which identifies possible \emph{lesion candidates}. In the second stage the algorithm analyzes each candidate lesion, \emph{candidate analysis}, to get a probability of malignancy. If the probability of malignancy exceeds a threshold value selected by the CAD manufacturer, and this is accomplished based on a compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and see Chapter \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(optim-op-point)} for my solution to this problem, the location of each candidate lesion satisfying the criterion is shown to the radiologist, Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-fitting-fig1}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{images/rsm-fitting/two-views} 

}

\caption{A typical 4-view display of a patient mammogram with the CAD cues (the red arrows) turned on.}\label{fig:rsm-fitting-fig1}
\end{figure}

According to TBA Eqn. (17.30), in the limit \(\zeta_1 \rightarrow -\infty\) the end-point coordinates of the FROC curve represent estimates of \(\lambda', \nu'\) respectively:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
\lambda' = & NLF_{max} \\
\nu' = & LLF_{max} 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-nlf-llf-max}
\end{equation}

In other words, in this limit two of the three parameters of the RSM are trivially determined from the location of the observed end-point. Suppressing all parameter independent terms, the log-likelihood function, Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-ll}, reduces to:

\begin{equation}
LL_{FROC}^{IDCA} = \sum_{r=1}^{R_{FROC}} \left \{ n_r log\left ( p_r \right ) + l_r log\left ( q_r \right ) \right \} \\
+ ...
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-ll2}
\end{equation}

Since the ignored terms in Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-ll2} are independent of model parameters they do not affect the maximization. The equation contains only one parameter, namely \(\mu\), which is implicit in the definition of \(q_r\), Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-pr-qr}.

Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-ll2} resembles the log-likelihood function for the binormal model, since, according to TBA Eqn. (6.37), the LL function for the binormal model with \(R_{FROC}\) bins, is \footnote{The number of ROC bins exceeds the number of FROC bins by one.}:

\begin{equation}
LL_{ROC} = \sum_{r=1}^{R_{FROC}} \left \{ K_{1r} log\left ( \left ( \Phi \left ( \zeta_{r+1} \right ) - \Phi \left ( \zeta_{r} \right ) \right ) \right ) + K_{2r} log\left ( \left ( \Phi\left ( b\zeta_{r+1} -a \right ) - \Phi\left ( b\zeta_{r} - a \right ) \right ) \right ) \right \} 
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-roc-ll}
\end{equation}

In this equation \(K_{1r}\) is the number of counts in bin \(r\) of an ROC study consisting of \(R_{FROC}\) bins. Define the unequal-variance binormal model versions of Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-pr-qr} as follows:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
p_r' = & \Phi\left ( \zeta_{r+1} \right ) - \Phi\left ( \zeta_r \right ) \\
q_r' = & \Phi\left ( b\zeta_{r+1} - a \right ) - \Phi\left ( b \zeta_r  - a \right ) 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-pr-qr-prime}
\end{equation}

Here \((a,b)\) are the parameters the unequal variance binormal model. Then Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-roc-ll} becomes,

\begin{equation}
LL_{ROC} = \sum_{r=1}^{R_{FROC}} \left \{ K_{1r} log\left ( p_r' \right ) + K_{2r} log\left ( q_r' \right ) \right \} 
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-roc-ll2}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  With the identifications \(K_{1r} \rightarrow n_r\) and \(K_{2r} \rightarrow l_r\), Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-roc-ll} looks exactly like Eqn. \eqref{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-ll2}. This implies that binormal ROC fitting method can be used to determine \(a\) and \(b\). Notice that instead of fitting an equal variance binormal model to determine the remaining single remaining \(\mu\) parameter of the RSM, one is using an unequal-variance binormal model with two parameters, \(a\) and \(b\). It turns out that the extra parameter helps. It gives some flexibility to the fitting curve to match the data.
\item
  This method of fitting FROC data was well known to CAD researchers but was first formalized in \citep{edwards2002maximum}.
\item
  Regard the NL marks as non-diseased ``cases'' (\(K_{1r} \rightarrow n_r\)) and the LL marks as diseased ``cases'' (\(K_{2r} \rightarrow l_r\)). Construct a pseudo-ROC counts table, analogous to TBA Table 4.1, where \(n_r\) is defined as the pseudo-FP counts in ratings bin \(r\), and likewise, \(l_r\) is defined as the pseudo-TP counts in ratings bin \(r\). The pseudo-ROC counts table has the same structure as the ROC counts table and can be fitted by the binormal model (or other alternatives).
\item
  The pseudo-FP and pseudo-TP counts can be used to define pseudo-FPF and pseudo-TPF in the usual manner; the respective denominators are the total number of NL and LL counts, respectively. These probabilities define the pseudo-ROC operating points.
\item
  The prefix ``pseudo'' is needed because one is regarding localized regions in a case as independent ``cases''. Since the fitting algorithm assumes each rating is from an independent case, one is violating a basic assumption, but with CAD data it appears one can get away with it, because the method yields good fits, especially with the extra parameter.
\item
  The fitted FROC curve is obtained by scaling (i.e., multiplying) the ROC curve along the y-axis by \(LLF_{max}\) and along the x-axis by \(NLF_{max}\). The method is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-fitting-fig2}.

\caption{The IDCA method of fitting designer-level CAD FROC data.}\label{fig:rsm-fitting-fig2}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-fitting-fig2}: The IDCA method of fitting designer-level CAD FROC data. In the upper half of the figure, the y-axis of the pseudo-ROC is pseudo-TPF and the x-axis is pseudo-FPF. The method is illustrated for a dataset with four FROC bins. Regarding the NLs and LLs as non-diseased and diseased cases, respectively, one constructs a table similar to Table 4.1, but this time with only four ROC bins (i.e., three non-trivial operating points). This defines the four operating points, the filled circles, including the trivial one at the upper right corner, shown in the upper half of the plot. One fits the ratings counts data using, for example, the binormal model, yielding the continuous line (based on experience the unequal variance binormal model is needed; the equal variance model does not fit as well). In practice, the operating points will not fall exactly on the fitted line. Finally, one scales (or ``stretches'', or multiplies) the y-axis by \(\nu'\). Likewise, the x-axis is scaled by \(\lambda'\). This yields the continuous line shown in the lower half of the figure. Upon adding the FROC operating points one finds that they are magically fitted by the line, which is a scaled replica of the ROC fit in the upper curve.

Reference has already been made to the fact that it is necessary to assume \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\) in order to remove the degeneracy problem. This is also evident from the fact that the uppermost point in Fig. \ref{fig:rsm-fitting-fig2} is at (1,1). A point at the upper-right corner must correspond to \(\zeta_1 = -\infty\), another confirmation of this assumption.

Assuming binormal fitting is employed, yielding parameters \(a\) and \(b\), the equations defining the IDCA fitted FROC curve are, see TBA Eqn. (6.19) and Eqn. (6.20):

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
NLF(\zeta) = & \lambda' \Phi\left ( -\zeta \right ) \\
LLF(\zeta) = & \nu' \Phi\left (a -b\zeta \right ) 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-froc-nlf-llf}
\end{equation}

The RSM predicted FROC curve is repeated below for convenience,

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
NLF(\zeta) = & \lambda' \Phi\left ( -\zeta \right ) \\
LLF(\zeta) = & \nu' \Phi\left (\mu -\zeta \right ) 
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-fitting-idca-froc-nlf-llf-rsm}
\end{equation}

IDCA uses the \emph{unequal variance} binormal model to fit the pseudo-ROC, which of course opens up the possibility of an inappropriate chance-line crossing and a predicted FROC curve that is non-monotonically increasing with NLF (this is always present with IDCA fits, but one would need to examine the curve near the end-point very closely to see it). In practice the unequal variance model gives visually good fits for CAD datasets.

In fact, IDCA yields excellent fits to some designer-level FROC datasets. However, the issue is not with the quality of the fits, rather the appropriateness of the FROC curve as a measure of performance, especially for human observers. For CAD the method works, so if one wished one could use IDCA to fit designer level CAD FROC data. However, with closely spaced operating points, the empirical FROC would also work and it does not involve any fitting assumptions. The issue is not fitting designer level CAD data but comparing stand-alone performance of designer level CAD to radiologists, and this is not solved by IDCA, which works for designer level CAD, but not for human observers. The latter do not report every suspicious region, no matter how low its confidence level, so the IDCA assumption \(\zeta_1 \rightarrow -\infty\) is invalid. The problem of analyzing standalone performance of CAD against a group of radiologists interpreting the same cases is addressed in TBA Chapter 22.

\section{Introduction}\label{rsm-3-fits-intro}}

A proper ROC curve is one whose slope decreases monotonically as the operating point moves up the curve, a consequence of which is that a proper ROC does not display an inappropriate chance line crossing followed by a sharp upward turn, i.e., a ``hook'', usually near the (1,1) upper right corner.

There are three methods for fitting proper curves to ROC datasets:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The radiological search model (RSM) described in Chapter \ref{rsm-fitting},
\item
  The PROPROC (proper ROC) and CBM (contaminated binormal model) described in TBA Chapter 20.
\end{itemize}

This chapter compares these methods for a number of datasets. Comparing the RSM to the binormal model would be inappropriate, as the latter does not predict proper ROCs.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Both RSM and CBM are implemented in \texttt{RJafroc}.
\item
  \texttt{PROPROC} is implemented in Windows software \footnote{OR DBM-MRMC 2.5, Sept.~04, 2014; the version used in this chapter is no longer distributed but is available from me upon request.} available \href{https://perception.lab.uiowa.edu/OR-DBM-MRMC-252}{here}, last accessed 1/4/21.

The RSM, PROPROC and CBM algorithms were applied to the 14 embedded datasets described in \ref{rsm-3-fits-14-datasets}. The datasets have already been analyzed and the location of pre-analyzed results files are in \ref{rsm-3-fits-pre-analyzed-results}.

All 10 composite plots for the Van Dyke dataset are shown in the Appendix to this chapter, \ref{rsm-3-fits-representative-plots-van-dyke}.

The next section provides an overview of the most salient findings from analyzing the datasets.

\hypertarget{rsm-3-fits-overview}{%
\section{Overview of findings}\label{rsm-3-fits-overview}}

With 14 datasets the total number of individual modality-reader combinations is 236: in other words, there are 236 datasets to each of which three algorithms were applied. It is easy to be overwhelmed by the numbers and this section summarizes the most important conclusion: \emph{for each dataset, treatment and reader, the three fitting methods are consistent with a single method-independent AUC}.

If the AUCs of the three methods are identical the following relations hold with slopes equal to unity:

\begin{equation}
\left. 
\begin{aligned}
AUC_{PRO} =& m_{PR} AUC_{PRO}  \\
AUC_{CBM} =& m_{CR} AUC_{PRO} \\
m_{PR}    =& 1 \\
m_{CR}    =& 1
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:rsm-3-fits-slopes-equation1}
\end{equation}

The abbreviations are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  PRO = PROPROC
\item
  PR = PROPROC vs.~RSM
\item
  CR = CBM vs.~RSM.
\end{itemize}

For each dataset the plot of PROPROC AUC vs.~RSM AUC should be linear with zero intercept and slope \(m_{PR}\). The reason for the \emph{zero intercept} is that if one of the AUCs indicates zero performance the other AUC must also be zero. Likewise, chance level performance (AUC = 0.5) must be common to all method of estimating AUC. Finally, perfect performance must be common to all methods.

\subsection{Slopes}\label{rsm-3-fits-slopes}}

Denote PROPROC AUC for dataset \(f\), treatment \(i\) and reader \(j\) by \(\theta^{PRO}_{fij}\). Likewise, the corresponding RSM and CBM values are denoted by \(\theta^{RSM}_{fij}\) and \(\theta^{CBM}_{fij}\), respectively. For a given dataset the slope of the PROPROC values vs.~the RSM values is denoted \(m_{PR,f}\). The (grand) average over all datasets is denoted \(m^{PR}_\bullet\). Likewise, the average of the CBM AUC values vs.~the RSM value is denoted \(m^{CR}_\bullet\).

An analysis was conducted to determine the average slopes and a bootstrap analysis was conducted to determine the corresponding confidence intervals.

The code for calculating the average slopes is in \texttt{R/compare-3-fits/slopesConvVsRsm.R} and that for calculating the bootstrap confidence intervals is in \texttt{R/compare-3-fits/slopesAucsConvVsRsmCI.R}.

\section{Discussion / Summary}\label{rsm-3-fits-discussion-summary}}

Over the years, there have been several attempts at fitting FROC data. Prior to the RSM-based ROC curve approach described in this chapter, all methods were aimed at fitting FROC curves, in the mistaken belief that this approach was using all the data. The earliest was my FROCFIT software TBA 36. This was followed by Swensson's approach37, subsequently shown to be equivalent to my earlier work, as far as predicting the FROC curve was concerned TBA 11. In the meantime, CAD developers, who relied heavily on the FROC curve to evaluate their algorithms, developed an empirical approach that was subsequently put on a formal basis in the IDCA method12.

This chapter describes an approach to fitting ROC curves, instead of FROC curves, using the RSM. Fits were described for 14 datasets, comprising 236 distinct treatment-reader combinations. All fits and parameter values are viewable in the online ``Supplemental Material'' directory corresponding to this chapter. Validity of fit was assessed by the chisquare goodness of fit p-value; unfortunately using adjacent bin combining this could not be calculated in most instances; ongoing research at other ways of validating the fits is underway. PROPROC and CBM were fitted to the same datasets, yielding further validation and insights. One of the insights was the finding that the AUCS were almost identical, with PROPROC yielding the highest value, followed by CBM and closely by the RSM. The PROPROC-AUC / CBM-AUC, vs.~RSM-AUC straight-line fits, constrained to go through the origin, had slopes 1.0255 (1.021, 1.030) and 1.0097 (1.006, 1.013), respectively. The \(R^2\) values were generally in excess of 0.999, indicative of excellent fits.

On the face of it, fitting the ROC curve seems to be ignoring much of the data. As an example, the ROC rating on a non-diseased case is the rating of the highest-rated mark on that image, or negative infinity if the case has no marks. If the case has several NL marks, only the highest rated one is used. In fact the highest rated mark contains information about the other marks on the case, namely they were all rated lower. There is a statistical term for this, namely sufficiency38. As an example, the highest of a number of samples from a uniform distribution is a sufficient statistic, i.e., it contains all the information contained in the observed samples. While not quite the same for normally distributed values, neglect of the NLs rated lower is not as bad as might seem at first. A similar argument applies to LLs and NLs on diseased cases. The advantage of fitting to the ROC is that the coupling of NLs and LLs on diseased cases breaks the degeneracy problem described in §18.2.3.

The reader may wonder why I chose not to fit the wAFROC TBA. After all, it is the recommended figure of merit for FROC studies. While the methods described in this chapter are readily adapted to the wAFROC, they are more susceptible to degeneracy issues. The reason is that the y-axis is defined by LL-events, in other words by the parameters, while the x-axis is defined by the highest rated NL on non-diseased cases, in other words by the parameter. The consequent decoupling of parameters leads to degeneracy of the type described in §18.2.3. This is avoided in ROC fitting because the y-axis is defined by LLs and NLs, in other words all parameters of the RSM are involved. The situation with the wAFROC is not quite as severe as with fitting FROC curves but it does have a problem with degeneracy. There are some ideas on how to improve the fits, perhaps by simultaneously fitting ROC and wAFROC-operating points, which amounts to putting constraints on the parameters, but for now this remains an open research subject. Empirical wAFROC, which is the current method implemented in RJafroc, is expected to have the same issues with variability of thresholds between treatments as the empirical ROC-AUC, as discussed in §5.9. So the fitting problem has to be solved. There is no need to fit the FROC, as it should never be used as a basis of a figure of merit for human observer studies; this is distinct from the severe degeneracy issues encountered with fitting it for human observers.

The application to a large number (236) of real datasets revealed that PROPROC has serious issues. These were apparently not revealed by the millions of simulations used to validate it39. To quote the cited reference, ``The new algorithm never failed to converge and produced good fits for all of the several million datasets on which it was tested''. This is a good illustration of why simulations studies are not a good alternative to the method described in §18.5.1.3. In my experience this is a common misconception in this field, and is discussed further in the following chapter. Fig. 18.5, panels (J), (K) and (L) show that PROPROC, and to a lesser extent CBM, can, under some circumstances, severely overestimate performance. Recommendations regarding usage of PROPROC and CBM are deferred to Chapter 20.

The current ROC-based effort led to some interesting findings. The near equality of the AUCs predicted by the three proper ROC fitting methods, summarized in Table 18.4, has been noted, which is explained by the fact that proper ROC fitting methods represent different approaches to realizing an ideal observer, and the ideal observer must be unique, §18.6.

This chapter explores what is termed inter-correlations, between RSM and CBM parameters. Since they have similar physical meanings, the RSM and CBM separation parameters were found to be significantly correlated, = 0.86 (0.76, 0.89), as were the RSM and CBM parameters corresponding to the fraction of lesions that was actually visible, = 0.77 (0.68, 0.82). This type of correspondence between two different models can be interpreted as evidence of mutually reinforcing validity of each of the models.

The CBM method comes closest to the RSM in terms of yielding meaningful measures, but the fact that it allows the ROC curve to go continuously to (1,1) implies that it is not completely accounting for search performance, §17.8. There are two components to search performance: finding lesions and avoiding non-lesions. The CBM model accounts for finding lesions, but it does not account for avoiding suspicious regions that are non-diseased, an important characteristic of expert radiologists.

An important finding is the inverse correlation between search performance and lesion-classification performance, which suggest there could be tradeoffs in attempts to optimize them. As a simplistic illustration, a low-resolution gestalt-view of the image1, such as seen by the peripheral viewing mechanism, is expected to make it easier to rapidly spot deviations from the expected normal template described in Chapter 15. However, the observer may not be able to switch effectively between this and the high-resolution viewing mode necessary to correctly classify found suspicious region.

The main scientific conclusion of this chapter is that search-performance is the primary bottleneck in limiting observer performance. It is unfortunate that search is ignored in the ROC paradigm, usage of which is decreasing, albeit at an agonizingly slow rate. Evidence presented in this chapter should convince researchers to reconsider the focus of their investigations, most of which is currently directed at improving classification performance, which has been shown not to be the bottleneck. Another conclusion is that the three method of fitting ROC data yield almost identical AUCs. Relative to the RSM the PROPROC estimates are about 2.6\% larger while CBM estimates are about 1\% larger. This was a serendipitous finding that makes sense, in retrospect, but to the best of my knowledge is not known in the research community. PROPROC and to a lesser extent CBM are prone to severely overestimating performance in situations where the operating points are limited to a steep ascending section at the low end of false positive fraction scale. This parallels an earlier comment regarding the FROC, namely measurements derived from the steep part of the curve are unreliable, §17.10.1.

\section{Abstract}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-abstract}}

Computer aided detection (CAD) research for screening mammography has so far focused on measuring performance of radiologists with and without CAD. Typically a group of radiologists interpret a set of images with and without CAD assist. Standalone performance of CAD algorithms is rarely measured. The stated reason for this is that in the clinic CAD is never used alone, rather it is always used with radiologists. For this reason interest has been focused on the incremental improvement afforded by CAD.

Another reason for the lack of focus on standalone CAD performance is the lack of clear methodology for measuring standalone CAD performance. This chapter extends the methodology used in a recent study of standalone performance. The method is termed random-reader fixed case (1T-RRFC), since it only accounts for reader variability but does not account for case-variability. The extension includes the effect of case-sampling variability. Since in the proposed method CAD is treated as an additional reader within a single treatment, the method is termed one-treatment random-reader random-case (1T-RRRC) analysis. The new method is based on existing methodology allowing comparison of the average performance of readers in a single treatment to a specified value. The key modification is to regard the difference in performance between radiologists and CAD as a figure of merit, to which the existing work is then directly applicable. The 1T-RRRC method was compared to 1T-RRFC. It was also compared to an unorthodox usage of conventional ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis software, termed 2T-RRRC analysis, which involves replicating the CAD ratings as many times as there are radiologists, to in effect simulate a second treatment, i.e., CAD is regarded as the second treatment. The proposed 1T-RRRC analysis has 3 random parameters as compared to 6 parameters in 2T-RRRC and one parameter in 1T-RRFC. As expected, since one is including an additional source of variability, both RRRC analyses (1T and 2T) yielded larger p-values and wider confidence intervals as compared to 1T-RRFC. For the F-statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value, both 1T-RRRC and 2T-RRRC analyses yielded exactly the same results. However, 2T-RRRC model parameter estimates were unrealistic; for example, it yields zero between-reader variance, whereas 1T-RRRC yielded the expected non-zero value. All three methods are implemented in an open-source \texttt{R} package \texttt{RJafroc.}

\section{Introduction}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-introduction}}

In the US the majority of screening mammograms are analyzed by computer aided detection (CAD) algorithms \citep{rao2010widely}. Almost all major imaging device manufacturers provide CAD as part of their imaging workstation display software. In the United States CAD is approved for use as a second reader \citep{fda2018guidance}, i.e., the radiologist first interprets the images (typically 4 views, 2 views of each breast) without CAD and then CAD information (i.e., cued suspicious regions, possibly shown with associated probabilities of malignancies) is shown and the radiologist has the opportunity to revise the initial interpretation. In response to the second reader usage, the evolution of CAD algorithms has been guided mainly by comparing observer performance of radiologists with and without CAD.

Clinical CAD systems sometimes only report the locations of suspicious regions, i.e., it may not provide ratings. However, a (continuous variable) malignancy index for every CAD-found suspicious region is available to the algorithm designer \citep{edwards2002maximum}. Standalone performance, i.e., performance of designer-level CAD by itself, regarded as an algorithmic reader, vs.~radiologists, is rarely measured. In breast cancer screening I am aware of only one study \citep{hupse2013standalone} where standalone performance was measured. {[}Standalone performance has been measured in CAD for computed tomography colonography, chest radiography and three dimensional ultrasound \citep{hein2010computeraided, summers2008performance, taylor2006computerassisted, deBoo2011computeraided, tan2012computeraided}{]}.

One possible reason for not measuring standalone performance of CAD is the lack of an accepted assessment methodology for such measurements. The purpose of this work is to remove that impediment.
It describes a method for comparing standalone performance of designer-level CAD to radiologists interpreting the same cases and compares the method to those described in two recent publications \citep{hupse2013standalone, kooi2016comparison}.

\hypertarget{standalone-cad-radiologists-methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-methods}}

Summarized are two recent studies of CAD vs.~radiologists in mammography. This is followed by comments on the methodologies used in the two studies. The second study used multi-treatment multi-reader receiver operating characteristic (ROC) software in an unorthodox or unconventional way. A statistical model and analysis method is described that avoids unorthodox, and perhaps unjustified, use of ROC software and has fewer model parameters.

\hypertarget{standalone-cad-radiologists-two-previous-studies}{%
\subsection{Studies assessing performance of CAD vs.~radiologists}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-two-previous-studies}}

The first study \citep{hupse2013standalone} measured performance in finding and localizing lesions in mammograms, i.e., visual search was involved, while the second study \citep{kooi2016comparison} measured lesion classification performance between non-diseased and diseased regions of interest (ROIs) previously found on mammograms by an independent algorithmic reader, i.e., visual search was not involved.

\hypertarget{standalone-cad-radiologists-study1}{%
\subsubsection{Study - 1}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-study1}}

The first study \citep{hupse2013standalone} compared standalone performance of a CAD device to that of 9 radiologists interpreting the same cases (120 non-diseased and 80 with a single malignant mass per case). It used the LROC (localization ROC) paradigm \citep{starr1975visual, metz1976observer, swensson1996unified}, in which the observer gives an overall rating for presence of disease (an integer 0 to 100 scale was used) and indicates the location of the most suspicious region. On a non-diseased case the rating is classified as a false positive (FP) but on a diseased case it is classified as a \emph{correct localization} (CL) if the location is sufficiently close to the lesion, and otherwise it is classified as an \emph{incorrect localization}. For a given reporting threshold, the number of correct localizations divided by the number of diseased cases estimates the probability of correct localization (PCL) at that threshold. On non-diseased cases the number of false positives (FPs) divided by the number of non-diseased cases estimates the probability of a false positive, or false positive fraction (FPF), at that threshold. The plot of PCL (ordinate) vs.~FPF defines the LROC curve. Study - 1 used as figures of merit (FOMs) the interpolated PCL at two values of FPF, specifically FPF = 0.05 and FPF = 0.2, denoted \(\text{PCL}_{0.05}\) and \(\text{PCL}_{0.2}\), respectively. The t-test between the radiologist \(\text{PCL}_{\text{FPF}}\) values and that of CAD was used to compute the two-sided p-value for rejecting the NH of equal performance. Study - 1 reported p-value = 0.17 for \(\text{PCL}_{0.05}\) and p-value \(\leq\) 0.001, with CAD being inferior, for \(\text{PCL}_{0.2}\).

\hypertarget{standalone-cad-radiologists-study2}{%
\subsubsection{Study - 2}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-study2}}

The second study \citep{kooi2016comparison} used 199 diseased and 199 non-diseased ROIs extracted by an independent CAD algorithm. These were interpreted using the ROC paradigm (i.e., rating only, no localization required) by a different CAD algorithmic observer from that used to determine the ROIs, and by four expert radiologists. The figure of merit was the empirical area (AUC) under the respective ROC curves (one per radiologist and one for CAD). The p-value for the difference in AUCs between the average radiologist and CAD was determined using an unorthodox application of the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz \citep{dorfman1992receiver} multiple-treatment multiple-reader multiple-case (DBM-MRMC) software with recent modifications \citep{hillis2008recent}. The unorthodox application was that in the input data file \emph{radiologists and CAD were entered as two treatments}. In conventional (or orthodox) DBM-MRMC each reader provides two ratings per case and the data file would consist of paired ratings of a set of cases interpreted by 4 readers. To accommodate the paired data structure assumed by the software, the authors of Study - 2 \emph{replicated the CAD ratings four times in the input data file}, as explained in the caption to Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table-conventional}. By this artifice they converted a single-treatment 5-reader (4 radiologists plus CAD) data file to a two-treatment 4-reader data file, in which the four readers in treatment 1 were the radiologists, and the four ``readers'' in treatment 2 were CAD replicated ratings. Note that for each case the four readers in the second treatment had identical ratings. In Table 1 the replicated CAD observers are labeled C1, C2, C3 and C4.

Study -- 2 reported a not significant difference between CAD and the radiologists (p = 0.253).

\hypertarget{standalone-cad-radiologists-comments}{%
\subsubsection{Comments}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-comments}}

For the purpose of this work, which focuses on the respective analysis methods, the difference in observer performance paradigms between the two studies, namely a search paradigm in Study - 1 vs.~an ROI classification paradigm in Study -- 2, is inconsequential. The paired t-test used in Study - 1 treats the case-sample as fixed. In other words, the analysis is not accounting for case-sampling variability but it is accounting for reader variability. While not explicitly stated, the reason for the unorthodox analysis in Study -- 2 was the desire to include case-sampling variability. \footnote{Prof.~Karssemeijer (private communication, 10/27/2017) had consulted with a few ROC experts to determine if the procedure used in Study -- 2 was valid, and while the experts thought it was probably valid they were not sure.}

In what follows, the analysis in Study -- 1 is referred to as random-reader fixed-case (1T-RRFC) while that in Study -- 2 is referred to as dual-treatment random-reader random-case (2T-RRRC).

\hypertarget{the-1t-rrfc-analysis-model}{%
\subsection{The 1T-RRFC analysis model}\label{the-1t-rrfc-analysis-model}}

The sampling model for the FOM is:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}
\theta_j=\mu+R_j \\
\left (j = 1,2,...J  \right )
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:standalone-1t-rrfc}
\end{equation}

Here \(\mu\) is a constant, \(\theta_j\) is the FOM for reader \(j\), and \(R_j\) is the random contribution for reader \(j\) distributed as:

\begin{equation}
R_j \sim  N\left ( 0,\sigma_R^2 \right )
\label{eq:standalone-cad-2t-rrfc-rj-sampling}
\end{equation}

Because of the assumed normal distribution of \(R_j\), in order to compare the readers to a fixed value, that of CAD denoted \(\theta_0\), one uses the (unpaired) t-test, as done in Study -- 1. As evident from the model, no allowance is made for case-sampling variability, which is the reason for calling it the 1T-RRFC method.

Performance of CAD on a fixed dataset does exhibit within-reader variability. The same algorithm applied repeatedly to a fixed dataset does not always produce the same mark-rating data. However, this source of CAD FOM variability is much smaller than inter-reader FOM variability of radiologists interpreting the same dataset. In fact the within-reader variability of radiologists is smaller than their inter-reader variability, and within-reader variability of CAD is even smaller still. For this reason one is justified in regarded \(\theta_0\) as a fixed quantity for a given dataset. Varying the dataset will result in different values for \(\theta_0\), i.e., its case sampling variability needs to be accounted for, as done in the following analyses.

\hypertarget{standalone-cad-radiologists-2TRRRC-anlaysis}{%
\subsection{The 2T-RRRC analysis model}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-2TRRRC-anlaysis}}

This could be termed the conventional or the orthodox method. There are two treatments and the study design is fully crossed: each reader interprets each case in each treatment, i.e., the data structure is as in the left half of Table 1.

The following approach, termed 2T-RRRC, uses the Obuchowski and Rockette (OR) figure of merit sampling model \citep{obuchowski1995hypothesis} instead of the pseudovalue-based model used in the original DBM paper \citep{dorfman1992receiver}. For the empirical FOM, Hillis has shown the two to be equivalent \citep{hillis2005comparison}.

The OR model is:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{ij\{c\}}=\mu+\tau_i+\left ( \tau \text{R} \right )_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij\{c\}}
\label{eq:standalone-cad-model-2t-rrrc}
\end{equation}

Assuming two treatments, \(i\) (\(i = 1, 2\)) is the treatment index, \(j\) (\(j = 1, ..., J\)) is the reader index, and \(k\) (\(k = 1, ..., K\)) is the case index, and \(\theta_{ij\{c\}}\) is a figure of merit for reader \(j\) in treatment \(i\) and case-sample \(\{c\}\). A case-sample is a set or ensemble of cases, diseased and non-diseased, and different integer values of \(c\) correspond to different case-samples.

The first two terms on the right hand side of Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-model-2t-rrrc} are fixed effects (average performance and treatment effect, respectively). The next two terms are random effect variables that, by assumption, are sampled as follows:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}  
R_j \sim  N\left ( 0,\sigma_R^2 \right )\\
\left ( \tau R \right )_{ij} \sim N\left ( 0,\sigma_{\tau R}^2 \right )\\
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:standalone-cad-2t-r-taur-sampling}
\end{equation}

The terms \(R_j\) represents the random treatment-independent contribution of reader \(j\), modeled as a sample from a zero-mean normal distribution with variance \(\sigma_R^2\), \(\left ( \tau R \right )_{ij}\) represents the random treatment-dependent contribution of reader \(j\) in treatment \(i\), modeled as a sample from a zero-mean normal distribution with variance \(\sigma_{\tau R}^2\). The sampling of the last (error) term is described by:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{ij\{c\}}\sim N_{I \times J}\left ( \vec{0} , \Sigma \right )
\label{eq:standalone-cad-2t-eps-sampling}
\end{equation}

Here \(N_{I \times J}\) is the \(I \times J\) variate normal distribution and \(\vec{0}\), a \(I \times J\) length zero-vector, represents the mean of the distribution. The \(\{I \times J\} \times \{I \times J\}\) dimensional covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) is defined by 4 parameters, \(\text{Var}\), \(\text{Cov}_1\), \(\text{Cov}_2\), \(\text{Cov}_3\), defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
\text{Cov} \left (\epsilon_{ij\{c\}},\epsilon_{i'j'\{c\}} \right ) =
\left\{\begin{matrix}
\text{Var} \; (i=i',j=j') \\
\text{Cov1} \; (i\ne i',j=j')\\ 
\text{Cov2} \; (i = i',j \ne j')\\ 
\text{Cov3} \; (i\ne i',j \ne j')
\end{matrix}\right\}
\label{eq:standalone-cad-2t-rrrc-cov}
\end{equation}

Software \{U of Iowa and \texttt{RJafroc}\} yields estimates of all terms appearing on the right hand side of Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-2t-rrrc-cov}. Excluding fixed effects, the model represented by Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-model-2t-rrrc} contains six parameters:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_R^2, \sigma_{\tau R}^2, \text{Var}, \text{Cov}_1, \text{Cov}_2, \text{Cov}_3
\label{eq:standalone-cad-2t-rrrc-varcom}
\end{equation}

The meanings the last four terms are described in \citep{hillis2007comparison, obuchowski1995hypothesis, hillis2005comparison, chakraborty2017observer}. Briefly, \(\text{Var}\) is the variance of a reader's FOMs, in a given treatment, over interpretations of different case-samples, averaged over readers and treatments; \(\text{Cov}_1/\text{Var}\) is the correlation of a reader's FOMs, over interpretations of different case-samples in different treatments, averaged over all different-treatment same-reader pairings; \(\text{Cov}_2/\text{Var}\) is the correlation of different reader's FOMs, over interpretations of different case-samples in the same treatment, averaged over all same- treatment different-reader pairings and finally, \(\text{Cov}_3/\text{Var}\) is the correlation of different reader's FOMs, over interpretations of different case-samples in different treatments, averaged over all different-treatment different-reader pairings. One expects the following inequalities to hold:

\begin{equation}
\text{Var} \geq \text{Cov}_1 \geq \text{Cov}_2 \geq \text{Cov}_3
\label{eq:standalone-cad-2t-rrrc-varcom-ordering}
\end{equation}

In practice, since one is usually limited to one case-sample, i.e., \(c = 1\), resampling techniques \citep{efron1994introduction} -- e.g., the jackknife -- are used to estimate these terms.

\hypertarget{standalone-cad-radiologists-1TRRRC-anlaysis}{%
\subsection{The 1T-RRRC analysis model}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-1TRRRC-anlaysis}}

This is the contribution of this work. The key difference from the approach in Study - 2 is to regard standalone CAD as a different reader, not as a different treatment. Therefore, needed is a single treatment method for analyzing readers and CAD, where the latter is regarded as an additional reader. Accordingly the proposed method is termed single-treatment RRRC (1T-RRRC) analysis.

The starting point is the \citep{obuchowski1995hypothesis} model for a single treatment, which for the radiologists (i.e., \emph{excluding} CAD) interpreting in a single-treatment reduces to the following model:

\begin{equation}
\theta_{j\{c\}}=\mu+R_j+\epsilon_{j\{c\}}
\label{eq:standalone-or-model-single-treatment}
\end{equation}

\(\theta_{j\{c\}}\) is the figure of merit for radiologist \(j\) (\(j = 1, 2, ..., J\)) interpreting case-sample \(\{c\}\); \(R_j\) is the random effect of radiologist \(j\) and \(\epsilon_{j\{c\}}\) is the error term. For single-treatment multiple-reader interpretations the error term is distributed as:

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{j\{c\}}\sim N_{J}\left ( \vec{0} , \Sigma \right )
\label{eq:standalone-cad-1t-eps-sampling}
\end{equation}

The \(J \times J\) covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) is defined by two parameters, \(\text{Var}\) and \(\text{Cov}_2\), as follows:

\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{jj'} = \text{Cov}\left ( \epsilon_{j\{c\}}, \epsilon_{j'\{c\}} \right )
=
\left\{\begin{matrix}
\text{Var} & j = j'\\ 
\text{Cov}_2 & j \neq j'
\end{matrix}\right.
\label{eq:standalone-cad-1t-var-cov2-sampling}
\end{equation}

The terms \(\text{Var}\) and \(\text{Cov}_2\) are estimated using resampling methods. Using the jackknife, and denoting the FOM with case \(k\) removed by \(\psi_{j(k)}\) (the index in parenthesis denotes deleted case \(k\), and since one is dealing with a single case-sample, the case-sample index \(c\) is now superfluous). The covariance matrix is estimated using (the dot symbol represents an average over the replaced index):

\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{jj'}|_\text{jack} = \frac{K-1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left ( \psi_{j(k)}  - \psi_{j(\bullet)} \right ) \left ( \psi_{j'(k)}  - \psi_{j'(\bullet)} \right )
\label{eq:standalone-cad-1t-sigma-jackknife}
\end{equation}

The final estimates of \(\text{Var}\) and \(\text{Cov}_2\) are averaged (indicated in the following equation by the angular brackets) over all pairings of radiologists satisfying the relevant equalities/inequalities shown just below the closing angular bracket:

\begin{equation}
\left.
\begin{aligned}  
\text{Var} = \left \langle \Sigma_{jj'}|_{\text{jack}} \right \rangle_{j=j'}\\
\text{Cov}_2 = \left \langle \Sigma_{jj'}|_{\text{jack}} \right \rangle_{j \neq j'}
\end{aligned}
\right \}
\label{eq:standalone-cad-1t-rrrc-var-cov2}
\end{equation}

Hillis' formulae \citep{hillis2005comparison, hillis2007comparison} permit one to test the NH: \(\mu = \mu_0\), where \(\mu_0\) is a pre-specified constant. One could set \(\mu_0\) equal to the performance of CAD, but that would not be accounting for the fact that the performance of CAD is itself a random variable, whose case-sampling variability needs to be accounted for.

Instead, the following model was used for the figure of merit of the radiologists and CAD (\(j = 0\) is used to denote the CAD algorithmic reader):

\begin{equation}
\theta_{j\{c\}} = \theta_{0\{c\}} + \Delta \theta + R_j + \epsilon_{j\{c\}}\\
j=1,2,...J
\label{eq:standalone-cad-1t-thetaj}
\end{equation}

\(\theta_{0\{c\}}\) is the CAD figure of merit for case-sample \(\{c\}\) and \(\Delta \theta\) is the average figure of merit increment of the radiologists over CAD. To reduce this model to one to which existing formulae are directly applicable, one subtracts the CAD figure of merit from each radiologist's figure of merit (for the same case-sample), and defines this as the difference figure of merit \(\psi_{j\{c\}}\) , i.e.,

\begin{equation}
\psi_{j\{c\}} = \theta_{j\{c\}} - \theta_{0\{c\}}
\label{eq:standalone-cad-diff-reader-def}
\end{equation}

Then Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-thetaj} reduces to:

\begin{equation}
\psi_{j\{c\}} = \Delta \theta + R_j + \epsilon_{j\{c\}}\\
j=1,2,...J
\label{eq:standalone-cad-1t-psi}
\end{equation}

Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-psi} is identical in form to Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-or-model-single-treatment} with the difference that the figure of merit on the left hand side of Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-psi} is a \emph{difference FOM}, that between the radiologist's and CAD. Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-psi} describes a model for \(J\) radiologists interpreting a common case set, each of whose performances is measured relative to that of CAD. Under the NH the expected difference is zero: \(\text{NH:} \Delta \theta = 0\). The method \citep{hillis2005comparison, hillis2007comparison} for single-treatment multiple-reader analysis is now directly applicable to the model described by Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-psi}.

Apart from fixed effects, the model in Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-psi} contains three parameters:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_R^2, \text{Var}, \text{Cov}_2
\label{eq:standalone-cad-1t-parms}
\end{equation}

Setting \(\text{Var} = 0, \text{Cov}_2 = 0\) yields the 1T-RRFC model, which contains only one random parameter, namely \(\sigma_R^2\).
{[}One expects identical estimates of \(\sigma_R^2\) using 1T-RRFC, 2T-RRRC or 1T-RRRC analyses.{]}

The three analyses, namely random-reader fixed-case (1T-RRFC), dual-treatment random-reader random-case (2T-RRRC) and single-treatment random-reader random-case (1T-RRRC), are implemented in \texttt{RJafroc}, an R-package \citep{packageRJafroc}.

The following code shows usage of the software to generate the results corrsponding to the three analyses. Note that \texttt{datasetCadLroc} is the LROC dataset and \texttt{dataset09} is the corresponding ROC dataset.

Results are shown for the following FOMs: \(\text{PCL}_{0.05}\), \(\text{PCL}_{0.2}\), \(\text{PCL}_{1}\), and the empirical area (AUC) under the ROC curve estimated by the Wilcoxon statistic. The first two FOMs are identical to those used in Study -- 1. Columns 3 and 4 list the CAD FOM \(\theta_0\) and its 95\% confidence interval \(CI_{\theta_0}\), columns 5 and 6 list the average radiologist FOM \(\theta_{\bullet}\) (the dot symbol represents an average over the radiologist index) and its 95\% confidence interval \(CI_{\theta_{\bullet}}\), columns 7 and 8 list the average difference FOM \(\psi_{\bullet}\), i.e., radiologist minus CAD, and its 95\% confidence interval \(CI_{\psi_{\bullet}}\), and the last three columns list the F-statistic, the denominator degrees of freedom (ddf) and the p-value for rejecting the null hypothesis. The numerator degree of freedom of the F-statistic, not listed, is unity.

In Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table2} identical values in adjacent cells in vertical columns have been replaced by the common values. The last three columns show that 2T-RRRC and 1T-RRRC analyses yield \emph{identical F-statistics, ddf and p-values}. So the intuition of the authors of Study -- 2, that the unorthodox method of using DBM -- MRMC software to account for both reader and case-sampling variability, turns out to be correct. If interest is solely in these statistics one is justified in using the unorthodox method.

Commented on next are other aspects of the results evident in Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table2}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Where a direct comparison is possible, namely 1T-RRFC analysis using and as FOMs, the p-values in Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table2} are similar to those reported in Study -- 1.
\item
  All FOMs (i.e., \(\theta_0\), \(\theta_{\bullet}\) and \(\psi_{\bullet}\)) in Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table2} are independent of the method of analysis. However, the corresponding confidence intervals (i.e., \(CI_{\theta_0}\), \(CI_{\theta_{\bullet}}\) and \(CI_{\psi_{\bullet}}\)) depend on the analyses.
\item
  Since 1T-RRFC analysis ignores case sampling variability, the CAD figure of merit is a constant, with zero-width confidence interval. For compactness the CI is listed as 0, rather than two identical values in parentheses. The confidence interval listed for 2T-RRRC analyses is centered on the corresponding CAD value, as are all confidence intervals in Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table2}.
\item
  The LROC FOMs increase as the value of FPF (the subscript) increases.
  This should be obvious, as PCL increases as FPF increases, a general feature of any partial curve based figure of merit.
\item
  The area (AUC) under the ROC is larger than the largest PCL value, i.e., \(AUC \geq \text{PCL}_1\). This too should be obvious from the general features of the LROC \citep{swensson1996unified}.
\item
  The p-value for either RRRC analyses (2T or 1T) is larger than the corresponding 1T-RRFC value. Accounting for case-sampling variability increases the p-value, leading to less possibility of finding a significant difference.
\item
  Partial curve-based FOMs, such as \(\text{PCL}_{FPF}\), lead, depending on the choice of \(FPF\), to different conclusions. The p-values generally decrease as FPF increases. Measuring performance on the steep part of the LROC curve (i.e., small FPF) needs to account for greater reader variability and risks lower statistical power.
\item
  Ignoring localization information (i.e., using the AUC FOM) led to a not-significant difference between CAD and the radiologists (\(p\) = 0.3210), while the corresponding FOM yielded a significant difference (\(p\) = 0.0409). Accounting for localization leads to a less ``noisy'' measurement. This has been demonstrated for the LROC paradigm \citep{swensson1996unified} and I have demonstrated this for the FROC paradigm \citep{chakraborty2008validation}.
\item
  For 1T-RRRC analysis, is listed as NA, for not applicable, since is not a model parameter, see Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-psi}.

The following characteristics are evident from Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table3}.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  For 2T-RRRC analyses \(\sigma_R^2 = 0\). Actually, the analysis yielded very small values, of the order of \(10^{-18}\) to \(10^{-19}\), which, being smaller than double precision accuracy, were replaced by zeroes in Table \ref{tab:standalone-cad-table2}. \(\sigma_R^2 = 0\) is clearly an incorrect result as the radiologists do not have identical performance. In contrast, 1T-RRRC analyses yielded more realistic values, identical to those obtained by 1T-RRFC analyses, and consistent with expectation -- see comment following Eqn. (15).
\item
  Because 2T analysis found zero reader variability, it follows from the definitions of the covariances \citep{obuchowski1995hypothesis}, that \(Cov_1 = Cov_3 = 0\), as evident in the table.
\item
  When they can be compared (i.e., \(\sigma_R^2\), \(\text{Cov}_2\) and \(\text{Var}\)), all variance and covariance estimates were smaller for the 2T method than for the 1T method.
\item
  For the 2T method the expected inequalities, Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-2t-rrrc-varcom-ordering}, are not obeyed (specifically, \(Cov_1 \geq Cov_2 \geq Cov_3\) is not obeyed).
\end{enumerate}

For an analysis method to be considered statistically valid it needs to be tested with simulations to determine if it has the proper null hypothesis behavior. The design of a ratings simulator to statistically match a given dataset is addressed in Chapter 23 of reference \citep{chakraborty2017observer}. Using this simulator, the 1T-RRRC method had the expected null hypothesis behavior (Table 23.5, ibid).

\section{Discussion}\label{standalone-cad-radiologists-discussion}}

TBA TODOLAST The argument often made for not measuring standalone performance is that since CAD will be used only as a second reader, it is only necessary to measure performance of radiologists without and with CAD. It has been stated \citep{nishikawa2011fundamental}:

\begin{quote}
High stand-alone performance is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for CAD to be truly useful clinically.
\end{quote}

Assessing CAD utility this way, i.e, by measuring performance with and without CAD, may have inadvertently set a low bar for CAD to be considered useful. As examples, CAD is not penalized for missing cancers as long as the radiologist finds them and CAD is not penalized for excessive false positives (FPs) as long as the radiologist ignores them. Moreover, since both such measurements include the variability of radiologists, there is additional noise introduces that presumably makes it harder to determine if the CAD system is optimal.

Described is an extension of the analysis used in Study -- 1 that accounts for case sampling variability. It extends \citep{hillis2005comparison} single-treatment analysis to a situation where one of the ``readers'' is a special reader, and the desire is to compare performance of this reader to the average of the remaining readers. The method, along with two other methods, was used to analyze an LROC data set using different figures of merit.

1T-RRRC analyses yielded identical overall results (specifically the F-statistic, degrees of freedom and p-value) to those yielded by the unorthodox application of DBM-MRMC software, termed 2T-RRRC analyses, where the CAD reader is regarded as a second treatment. However, the values of the model parameters of the dual-treatment analysis lacked clear physical meanings. In particular, the result \(\sigma_R^2 = 0\) is clearly an artifact. One can only speculate as to what happens when software is used in a manner that it was not designed for: perhaps finding that all readers in the second treatment have identical FOMs led the software to yield \(\sigma_R^2 = 0\). The single-treatment model has half as many parameters as the dual-treatment model and the parameters have clear physical meanings and the values are realistic.

The paradigm used to collect the observer performance data - e.g., receiver operating characteristic (ROC) \citep{metz1986rocmethodology}, free-response ROC (FROC) \citep{Chakraborty1986DigitalVsConv}, location ROC (LROC) \citep{starr1975visual} or region of interest (ROI) \citep{obuchowski2010data} - is irrelevant -- all that is needed is a scalar performance measure for the actual paradigm used. In addition to PCL and AUC, RJafroc currently implements the partial area under the LROC, from FPF = 0 to a specified value as well other FROC-paradigm based FOMs.

While there is consensus that CAD works for microcalcifications, for masses its performance is controversial27,28. Two large clinical studies TBA 29,30 (222,135 and 684,956 women, respectively) showed that CAD actually had a detrimental effect on patient outcome. A more recent large clinical study has confirmed the negative view of CAD31 and there has been a call for ending Medicare reimbursement for CAD interpretations32.

In my opinion standalone performance is the most direct measure of CAD performance. Lack of clear-cut methodology to assess standalone CAD performance may have limited past CAD research. The current work hopoefully removes that impediment. Going forward, assessment of standalone performance of CAD vs.~expert radiologists is strongly encouraged.

The results are displayed as three data frames.

The first data frame :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{fom\_individual\_rad} shows the figures of merit for the nine radiologists in the study.
\end{itemize}

The next data frame summarizes the statistics.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{fomCAD} is the figure of merit for CAD.
\item
  \texttt{avgRadFom} is the average figure of merit of the nine radiologists in the study.
\item
  \texttt{avgDiffFom} is the average difference figure of merit, RAD - CAD.
\item
  \texttt{varR} is the variance of the figures of merit for the nine radiologists in the study.
\item
  \texttt{Tstat} is the t-statistic for testing the NH that the average difference FOM \texttt{avgDiffFom} is zero, whose square is the F-statistic.
\item
  \texttt{df} is the degrees of freedom of the t-statistic.
\item
  \texttt{pval} is the p-value for rejecting the NH. In the example shown below the value is highly signficant.
\end{itemize}

The last data frame summarizes the 95 percent confidence intervals.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{CIAvgRadFom} is the 95 percent confidence interval, listed as pairs \texttt{Lower}, \texttt{Upper}, for \texttt{avgRadFom}.
\item
  \texttt{CIAvgDiffFom} is the 95 percent confidence interval for \texttt{avgDiffFom}.
\item
  If the pair \texttt{CIAvgDiffFom} excludes zero, the difference is statistically significant.
\item
  In the example the interval excludes zero showing that the FOM difference is significant.
\end{itemize}

In addition to the quantities defined previously, the output contains the covariance matrix for the Obuchowski-Rockette model, summarized in Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-model-2t-rrrc} -- Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-2t-rrrc-cov}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{varTR} is \(\sigma_{\tau R}^2\).
\item
  \texttt{cov1} is \(\text{Cov}_1\).
\item
  \texttt{cov2} is \(\text{Cov}_2\).
\item
  \texttt{cov3} is \(\text{Cov}_3\).
\item
  \texttt{Var} is \(\text{Var}\).
\item
  \texttt{FStat} is the F-statistic for testing the NH.
\item
  \texttt{ndf} is the numerator degrees of freedom, equal to unity.
\item
  \texttt{df} is denominator degrees of freedom of the F-statistic for testing the NH.
\item
  \texttt{Tstat} is the t-statistic for testing the NH that the average difference FOM \texttt{avgDiffFom} is zero.
\item
  \texttt{pval} is the p-value for rejecting the NH. In the example shown below the value is signficant.
\end{itemize}

Notice that including the variability of cases results in a higher p-value for 2T-RRRC as compared to 1T-RRFC.

The differences from \texttt{RRFC\_1T\_PCL\_0\_2} are listed next:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{varR} is \(\sigma_R^2\) of the single treatment model for comparing CAD to RAD, Eqn. \eqref{eq:standalone-cad-1t-parms}.
\item
  \texttt{cov2} is \(\text{Cov}_2\) of the single treatment model for comparing CAD to RAD.
\item
  \texttt{varError} is \(\text{Var}\) of the single treatment model for comparing CAD to RAD.
